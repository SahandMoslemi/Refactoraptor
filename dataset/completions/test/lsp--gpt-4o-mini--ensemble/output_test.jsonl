Ideally, the class should focus on a single responsibility, such as just representing the bird's characteristics or its behaviors.\n\n**OCP: 2 -** The `Bird` class is not open for extension in a clean way. If we want to add a new type of bird with different flying capabilities, we have to modify the existing codebase. The `Fly` and `GetFlightSpeed` methods are tightly coupled to the `Bird` class, making it difficult to extend without modifying existing code.\n\n**LSP: 2 -** The `Ostrich` class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it cannot be used interchangeably with other `Bird` subclasses in contexts where flying is expected. The `Fly` method throws an exception, which is not a behavior that other bird types exhibit. This means that an `Ostrich` cannot be treated as a `Bird` in all scenarios.\n\n**ISP: 4 -** The interface segregation principle is not directly applicable here since there are no interfaces defined. However, if we consider the abstract class `Bird` as an interface, it forces all derived classes to implement `Fly` and `GetFlightSpeed`, even if they do not support flying (like `Ostrich`). This could be seen as a violation of ISP.\n\n**DIP: 4 -** The `FlightSimulator` class depends directly on the `Bird` class. While it is abstracted to some extent, it still relies on concrete implementations of `Bird`.

While they are somewhat cohesive, the validation logic could be separated out for better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.\n- OCP: 2 - The current design is not open for extension. If a new payment method is introduced, the existing classes would need to be modified, which violates the Open/Closed Principle. Ideally, new payment methods should be added without altering existing code.\n- LSP: 4 - The subclasses generally adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, as they can be used interchangeably without altering the correctness of the program. However, the specific validation rules for each payment method could lead to unexpected behavior if not properly documented.\n- ISP: 3 - The `PaymentProcessor` interface could be seen as violating the Interface Segregation Principle because it forces all payment processors to implement methods that may not be relevant to all types of payments. For example, a payment method that does not require validation might still need to implement the `validatePayment` method.\n- DIP: 3 - The code does not fully adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle. The high-level module (the client code that uses `PaymentProcessor`) depends on the low-level modules (specific payment processors). Ideally, the high-level module should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP\n\nThe most impactful violation is the Open/Closed Principle because the current design requires modification of existing classes to add new payment methods. This can lead to increased risk of bugs and maintenance challenges as the system grows. A better design would allow for new payment methods to be added without changing existing code, promoting scalability and maintainability.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 8.448534727096558}

Each processor type (e.g., `StreamProcessor`, `DatabaseProcessor`) also has its own responsibilities, which could lead to a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n- OCP: 2 - The `DataProcessor` class is not open for extension in a clean way. Adding new processing types requires modifying the existing codebase, which violates the Open/Closed Principle. Each new processor type must be added to the `ProcessingOrchestrator`, which is not ideal.\n- LSP: 4 - The `DatabaseProcessor` class throws an exception when `processData` is called, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a user expects all processors to behave uniformly. This could violate the Liskov Substitution Principle, as it does not adhere to the expected contract of the `processData` method.\n- ISP: 4 - The `DataProcessor` class exposes several methods that may not be relevant to all subclasses. For instance, `cleanup` and `validateInput` may not be applicable to all types of data processing, which could lead to unnecessary complexity for some implementations.\n- DIP: 3 - The `ProcessingOrchestrator` is tightly coupled to the `DataProcessor` implementations. It directly depends on concrete classes rather than abstractions, which makes it harder to modify or extend the system without changing the orchestrator itself.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP\n\nThe most impactful violation is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because the design requires modifications to existing classes to add new functionality.

Each processor type (e.g., `StreamProcessor`, `DatabaseProcessor`) also has its own responsibilities, which could lead to a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n- OCP: 2 - The `DataProcessor` class is not open for extension in a clean way. Adding new processing types requires modifying the existing codebase, which violates the Open/Closed Principle. Each new processor type must be added to the `ProcessingOrchestrator`, which is not ideal.\n- LSP: 4 - The `DatabaseProcessor` class throws an exception when `processData` is called, which could lead to unexpected behavior if a user expects all processors to behave uniformly. This could violate the Liskov Substitution Principle, as it does not adhere to the expected contract of the `processData` method.\n- ISP: 4 - The `DataProcessor` class exposes several methods that may not be relevant to all subclasses. For instance, `cleanup` and `validateInput` may not be applicable to all types of data processing, which could lead to unnecessary complexity for some implementations.\n- DIP: 3 - The `ProcessingOrchestrator` is tightly coupled to the `DataProcessor` implementations. It directly depends on concrete classes rather than abstractions, which makes it harder to modify or extend the system without changing the orchestrator itself.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP\n\nThe most impactful violation is the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because the design requires modifications to existing classes to add new functionality. This can lead to increased risk of bugs and maintenance challenges as the system grows, making it less adaptable to change.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 4.334411144256592}
