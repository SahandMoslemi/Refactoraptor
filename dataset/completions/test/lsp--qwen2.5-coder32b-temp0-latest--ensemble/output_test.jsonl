The `Document` class is responsible for managing content, permissions, metadata, and various operations such as saving, printing, exporting, compressing, backing up, adding watermarks, and digitally signing. This makes the class overly complex and difficult to maintain. Each of these responsibilities should be handled by separate classes or modules. For example, document management could be separated from document operations, and each operation (save, print, export, etc.) could be encapsulated in its own class or service. This would make the codebase more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "SOLID RATINGS:\n- SRP: 2 - [reasoning]: The `Document` class has multiple responsibilities such as managing content, permissions, metadata, and various operations (save, print, export, etc.).

For example, `LegacyDocument` throws exceptions for methods that should be supported by a document (save, print, export), which can lead to unexpected behavior in client code.\n- ISP: 2 - [reasoning]: The `Document` interface is too broad and includes methods that may not be relevant to all subclasses. For example, `LegacyDocument` does not support many of the operations defined in the `Document` class, leading to unnecessary method implementations that throw exceptions.\n- DIP: 3 - [reasoning]: The `Document` class depends on concrete classes (like `EnterpriseWordDocument` and `LegacyDocument`) rather than abstractions. This makes it harder to swap out document types without modifying the code that uses them.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: SRP\n\n**SRP**\n\n[Explanation of violation]\n\nThe most impactful violation in this code is the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The `Document` class is responsible for managing content, permissions, metadata, and various operations such as saving, printing, exporting, compressing, backing up, adding watermarks, and digitally signing. This makes the class overly complex and difficult to maintain. Each of these responsibilities should be handled by separate classes or modules. For example, document management could be separated from document operations, and each operation (save, print, export, etc.) could be encapsulated in its own class or service. This would make the codebase more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 17.065785884857178}
