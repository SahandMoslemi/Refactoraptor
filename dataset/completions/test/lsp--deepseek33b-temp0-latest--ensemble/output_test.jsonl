This makes it difficult to add new processors without modifying existing code.\n- LSP: 5 - The Liskov Substitution Principle is well followed as there are no methods that break the contract defined by their superclasses or interfaces.\n- ISP: 4 - While not fully adhered to, the Interface Segregation Principle is somewhat violated in this code. Some of the interfaces have more than one responsibility which can lead to unnecessary dependencies. For example, `DataProcessor` interface has methods for processing data and cleaning up resources.\n- DIP: 5 - The Dependency Inversion Principle is well followed as high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but both depend on abstractions. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain or replace dependencies.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP\n\nThe violation of Open/Closed Principle is that `ProcessingOrchestrator` class directly depends on concrete implementations of `DataProcessor` classes. This makes it difficult to add new processors without modifying existing code. To fix this, we could use dependency injection and provide a factory method or interface for creating the processor instances.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 16.845643281936646}

It does not have any other responsibilities such as managing document content or performing operations on the document.\n- OCP: 3 - While the code does allow for extension by creating new classes that inherit from `Document`, it does not follow the Open/Closed Principle because if we want to add a new type of document (e.g., Word Document), we would have to modify the existing class which violates the open-closed principle.\n- LSP: 5 - The code follows the Liskov Substitution Principle as it does not use any methods that are not in the base class or interface. All subclasses (`PDFDocument` and `ReadOnlyDocument`) can be substituted for their superclass without causing errors.\n- ISP: 5 - The code follows the Interface Segregation Principle because each interface has only one responsibility, which is to define methods for saving and printing documents. There are no unnecessary or redundant methods in any of the interfaces.\n- DIP: 5 - The code follows the Dependency Inversion Principle as it does not depend on low-level modules but rather on high-level abstractions (i.e., abstract classes/interfaces). This makes the system more flexible and easier to maintain or modify in the future.\n\n**MOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP**\n\nThe Open/Closed Principle is violated because if we want to add a new type of document (e.g., Word Document), we would have to modify the existing class which can lead to code that is hard to maintain and understand.

They are responsible for both creating documents and managing their lifecycle, which goes against the principle of single responsibility.\n- OCP: 5 - The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is violated in this code because the `EnterpriseDocument` class is closed to modification but open to extension. This means that we can modify the behavior of existing methods within the class, but we cannot add new functionality without modifying the class itself.\n- LSP: 5 - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is violated in this code because the `LegacyDocument` class does not adhere to the contract defined by its superclass, `EnterpriseDocument`. This means that we cannot substitute a `LegacyDocument` object for an `EnterpriseDocument` object without causing errors or unexpected behavior.\n- ISP: 5 - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is violated in this code because the `EnterpriseDocument` class implements methods that are not relevant to its functionality, such as `addCollaborator()` and `startEditing()` for a legacy document. This means that we are forcing clients of the class to depend on interfaces they do not use, which goes against the principle of interface segregation.\n- DIP: 5 - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is violated in this code because high-level modules directly depend on low-level modules, rather than depending on abstractions.
