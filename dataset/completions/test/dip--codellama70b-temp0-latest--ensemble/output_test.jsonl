OCP: 4 - The NotificationService class is not open for extension because it uses conditional statements (if-else) to handle different email providers. If a new provider needs to be added, the code will need to be modified. It would be better to use polymorphism and dependency injection to support adding new providers without modifying existing code.\n3. LSP: 5 - The NotificationService class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it has multiple responsibilities that are not related to each other (sending notifications, sending welcome emails, and sending password reset emails). It would be better to separate these responsibilities into different classes or methods.\n4. ISP: 3 - The NotificationService class depends on both GmailService and OutlookService even if only one of them is used. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it requires unnecessary dependencies. It would be better to use separate interfaces for each email provider, and inject only the necessary interface based on the selected provider.\n5. DIP: 4 - The NotificationService class depends directly on GmailService and OutlookService, which violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it creates a tight coupling between the classes. It would be better to use abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) for email providers and inject them into the NotificationService using dependency injection.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: OCP\n\n**Open-Closed Principle Violation**\n\nThe NotificationService class is not open for extension because it uses conditional statements (if-else) to handle different email providers. If a new provider needs to be added, the code will need to be modified. This violates the Open-Closed Principle because it requires modifying existing code instead of extending it by adding new behavior.\n\nTo fix this, we can use polymorphism and dependency injection to support adding new providers without modifying existing code. We can create an EmailProvider interface with a sendEmail method, and implement it in GmailService and OutlookService classes. Then, we can inject the appropriate provider into the NotificationService using dependency injection. This way, adding a new email provider will not require modifying existing code.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 21.178190231323242}
