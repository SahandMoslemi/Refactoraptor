Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities.\n\nHere is the code:\nusing System;\n\ninterface IMusicPlayer\n{\n    void Play();\n    void Pause();\n    void Stop();\n    void SkipTrack();\n    void Eject();\n    void SetVolume(int volume);\n    void SetEqualizer(string preset);\n    void DisplayTrackInfo();\n    void Shuffle();\n    void Repeat();\n}\n\ninterface IAdvancedAudioDevice\n{\n    void ConnectBluetooth();\n    void DisconnectBluetooth();\n    void PairDevice(string deviceName);\n    void EnableMicrophone();\n    void DisableMicrophone();\n    void FirmwareUpdate();\n}\n\nclass CDPlayer : IMusicPlayer\n{\n    private bool isPlaying = false;\n    private bool isPaused = false;\n    private string currentTrack = \"Track 1\";\n    private int volume = 50;\n    private bool shuffleMode = false;\n    private bool repeatMode = false;\n\n    public void Play()\n    {\n        isPlaying = true;\n        isPaused = false;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Playing \" + currentTrack);\n    }\n\n    public void Pause()\n    {\n        if (isPlaying)\n        {\n            isPaused = true;\n            isPlaying = false;\n            Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Paused\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void Stop()\n    {\n        isPlaying = false;\n        isPaused = false;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Stopped\");\n    }\n\n    public void SkipTrack()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Skipping to next track\");\n        currentTrack = \"Track \" + (int.Parse(currentTrack.Split(' ')[1]) + 1);\n    }\n\n    public void Eject()\n    {\n        Stop();\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: CD ejected\");\n    }\n\n    public void SetVolume(int volume)\n    {\n        this.volume = volume;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Volume set to \" + volume);\n    }\n\n    public void SetEqualizer(string preset)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Equalizer set to \" + preset);\n    }\n\n    public void DisplayTrackInfo()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Current track - \" + currentTrack + \", Volume: \" + volume);\n    }\n\n    public void Shuffle()\n    {\n        shuffleMode = !shuffleMode;\n        Console.WriteLine(\"CD Player: Shuffle \" + (shuffleMode ?

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single

Each of these classes calls the superclass's constructor (`__init__` method) with a specific type of operator (driver, pilot, or captain).\n- The `get_operator` method is inherited by all subclasses and returns the current operator of the vehicle. \n\nYou can create instances of these classes like this:\n```python\ncar = Car(\"John Doe\")\nplane = Plane(\"Jane Smith\")\nsubmarine = Submarine(\"Captain Crunch\")\n\nprint(car.get_operator())        # Outputs: John Doe\nprint(plane.get_operator())      # Outputs: Jane Smith\nprint(submarine.get_operator())  # Outputs: Captain Crunch\n```", "violation": "Unknown", "violation_list": [], "explanation": "It seems like you're trying to create a set of classes for different types of vehicles, such as cars, planes, and submarines.

A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities.\n\nHere is the code:\nusing System;\n\ninterface IRestaurantWorker\n{\n    void CookFood();\n    void ServeCustomers();\n    void CleanTables();\n    void ManageStaff();\n}\n\ninterface IMachineWorker\n{\n    void WashDishes();\n    void VacuumFloor();\n    void SelfDiagnose();\n}\n\nclass Chef : IRestaurantWorker\n{\n    public void CookFood()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Chef is cooking meals.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ServeCustomers()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Chef does not serve customers.\");\n    }\n\n    public void CleanTables()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Chef does not clean tables.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ManageStaff()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Chef does not manage staff.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Waiter : IRestaurantWorker\n{\n    public void CookFood()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Waiter does not cook food.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ServeCustomers()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Waiter is serving customers.\");\n    }\n\n    public void CleanTables()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Waiter is cleaning tables.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ManageStaff()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Waiter does not manage staff.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Manager : IRestaurantWorker\n{\n    private bool conflict = true;\n\n    public void CookFood()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Manager does not cook.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ServeCustomers()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Manager does not serve.\");\n    }\n\n    public void CleanTables()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Manager does not clean.\");\n    }\n\n    public void ManageStaff()\n    {\n        if (conflict)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Manager is resolving a team conflict.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Manager is approving staff schedules.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dishwasher : IMachineWorker\n{\n    int dirtyItems = 15;\n\n    public void WashDishes()\n    {\n        if (dirtyItems > 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Dishwasher is cleaning \" + dirtyItems + \" plates.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"No dishes to clean.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void VacuumFloor()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Dishwasher cannot vacuum the floor.\");\n    }\n\n    public void SelfDiagnose()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Dishwasher performing self-diagnosis.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass VacuumCleaner : IMachineWorker\n{\n    bool isCharged = false;\n\n    public void WashDishes()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Vacuum cleaner cannot wash dishes.\");\n    }\n\n    public void VacuumFloor()\n    {\n        if (isCharged)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Vacuum cleaner is cleaning the floor.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Vacuum cleaner battery is low.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void SelfDiagnose()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Vacuum cleaner running diagnostics.\");\n    }\n}\n", "raw_response": "**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single

A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities.\n\nHere is the code:\ninterface MusicPlayer {\n    void play();\n    void pause();\n    void stop();\n    void skipTrack();\n    void eject();\n    void setVolume(int volume);\n    void setEqualizer(String preset);\n    void displayTrackInfo();\n    void shuffle();\n    void repeat();\n}\n\ninterface AdvancedAudioDevice {\n    void connectBluetooth();\n    void disconnectBluetooth();\n    void pairDevice(String deviceName);\n    void enableMicrophone();\n    void disableMicrophone();\n    void firmwareUpdate();\n}\n\nclass CDPlayer implements MusicPlayer {\n    private boolean isPlaying = false;\n    private boolean isPaused = false;\n    private String currentTrack = \"Track 1\";\n    private int volume = 50;\n    private boolean shuffleMode = false;\n    private boolean repeatMode = false;\n\n    @Override\n    public void play() {\n        isPlaying = true;\n        isPaused = false;\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Playing \" + currentTrack);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void pause() {\n        if (isPlaying) {\n            isPaused = true;\n            isPlaying = false;\n            System.out.println(\"CD Player: Paused\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        isPlaying = false;\n        isPaused = false;\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Stopped\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void skipTrack() {\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Skipping to next track\");\n        currentTrack = \"Track \" + (Integer.parseInt(currentTrack.split(\" \")[1]) + 1);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void eject() {\n        stop();\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: CD ejected\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setVolume(int volume) {\n        this.volume = volume;\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Volume set to \" + volume);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setEqualizer(String preset) {\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Equalizer set to \" + preset);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void displayTrackInfo() {\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Current track - \" + currentTrack + \", Volume: \" + volume);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void shuffle() {\n        shuffleMode = !shuffleMode;\n        System.out.println(\"CD Player: Shuffle \" + (shuffleMode ?

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

"You are an expert in identifying and refactoring SOLID principle violations in JAVA code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single

The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Here's an example of how you might structure the classes for a simple text-based RPG game:\n\n```python\nclass Character:\n    def __init__(self, name, health):\n        self.name = name\n        self.health = health\n    \n    def take_damage(self, damage):\n        self.health -= damage\n        if self.health <= 0:\n            print(f\"{self.name} has been defeated.\")\n\nclass Player(Character):\n    def __init__(self, name, health, strength):\n        super().__init__(name, health)\n        self.strength = strength\n    \n    def attack(self, enemy):\n        damage_dealt = self.strength * 2\n        print(f\"{self.name} attacks {enemy.name} for {damage_dealt} damage.\")\n        enemy.take_damage(damage_dealt)\n\nclass Enemy(Character):\n    def __init__(self, name, health, strength):\n        super().__init__(name, health)\n        self.strength = strength\n    \n    def attack(self, player):\n        damage_dealt = self.strength * 2\n        print(f\"{self.name} attacks {player.name} for {damage_dealt} damage.\")\n        player.take_damage(damage_dealt)\n```\nIn this example, `Character` is a base class that both the `Player` and `Enemy` classes inherit from. The `Player` and `Enemy` classes have additional attributes (like strength), and they also have an attack method which deals damage to another character. \n\nYou can create instances of these classes in your game, and use their methods to control the flow of the game:\n\n```python\nplayer = Player(\"Hero\", 100, 20)\nenemy = Enemy(\"Ogre\", 80, 15)\n\nwhile player.health > 0 and enemy.health > 0:\n    player.attack(enemy)\n    if enemy.health > 0:\n        enemy.attack(player)\n```\nThis will continue to let the player and enemy attack each other until one of them is defeated. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example, and you would likely want to add more features (like different types of enemies or players, items for the player to use, etc.) in a real game.", "violation": "Unknown", "violation_list": [], "explanation": "It seems like you're trying to create a text-based game in Python, but your code is incomplete or incorrect.

A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities.\n\nHere is the code:\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\n\nclass MusicPlayer(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def play(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def pause(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def stop(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def skip_track(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def eject(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def set_volume(self, volume):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def set_equalizer(self, preset):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def display_track_info(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def shuffle(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def repeat(self):\n        pass\n\n\nclass AdvancedAudioDevice(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def connect_bluetooth(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def disconnect_bluetooth(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def pair_device(self, device_name):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def enable_microphone(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def disable_microphone(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def firmware_update(self):\n        pass\n\n\nclass CDPlayer(MusicPlayer):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.is_playing = False\n        self.is_paused = False\n        self.current_track = \"Track 1\"\n        self.volume = 50\n        self.shuffle_mode = False\n        self.repeat_mode = False\n    \n    def play(self):\n        self.is_playing = True\n        self.is_paused = False\n        print(f\"CD Player: Playing {self.current_track}\")\n    \n    def pause(self):\n        if self.is_playing:\n            self.is_paused = True\n            self.is_playing = False\n            print(\"CD Player: Paused\")\n    \n    def stop(self):\n        self.is_playing = False\n        self.is_paused = False\n        print(\"CD Player: Stopped\")\n    \n    def skip_track(self):\n        print(\"CD Player: Skipping to next track\")\n        track_number = int(self.current_track.split(\" \")[1]) + 1\n        self.current_track = f\"Track {track_number}\"\n    \n    def eject(self):\n        self.stop()\n        print(\"CD Player: CD ejected\")\n    \n    def set_volume(self, volume):\n        self.volume = volume\n        print(f\"CD Player: Volume set to {volume}\")\n    \n    def set_equalizer(self, preset):\n        print(f\"CD Player: Equalizer set to {preset}\")\n    \n    def display_track_info(self):\n        print(f\"CD Player: Current track -

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single

A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n<Explanation of the violation>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\nThis class violates the Single
