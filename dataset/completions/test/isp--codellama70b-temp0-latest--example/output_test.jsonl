The `Car` class no longer implements the `Fly` method, as it is not a flyable vehicle.\n\nThe explanation of the refactoring:\n\n\"By separating the `IFlyableVehicle` interface from the `IVehicle` interface, we ensure that only vehicles that can actually fly implement the `Fly` method.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

an expert in identifying and refactoring SOLID principle violations in JAVA code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

"You are an expert in identifying and refactoring SOLID principle violations in JAVA code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

principle violations in JAVA code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```kotlin\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

refactoring SOLID principle violations in KOTLIN code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```kotlin\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```kotlin\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

refactoring SOLID principle violations in KOTLIN code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

refactoring SOLID principle violations in PYTHON code. Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```python\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.
