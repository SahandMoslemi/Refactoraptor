For example, the Bow class only deals with bow related tasks and so on.\n- OCP: 4 - While there are some classes that could be extended (like the Enemy class), not all of them are extensible. The Bow class is a good example where new bows can be added without modifying existing code.\n- LSP: 5 - The Liskov Substitution Principle is fully adhered to in this code as there are no methods that break the principle. For example, all subclasses of Enemy (like Spider and Dragon) can replace their superclass without causing any issues.\n- ISP: 4 - While not all interfaces are segregated perfectly, they do serve a purpose. The IEnemy interface is a good example where it only contains methods related to enemy behavior.\n- DIP: 5 - The Dependency Inversion Principle is fully adhered to in this code as high level modules (like the Game class) do not depend on low level modules directly but through abstractions (like interfaces). For example, the Game class does not depend on specific enemy classes but rather on the IEnemy interface.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: NONE\n\nExplanation: There are no violations of any SOLID principle in this code. Each class has a single responsibility and can be substituted for their superclasses without causing issues, which adheres to the Liskov Substitution Principle. The interfaces are segregated well and do not contain methods that are not related to their purpose, which adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle. High level modules (like the Game class) depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than low level modules, which adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 18.90943741798401}

For example, the `Weapon` class only handles weapon related tasks and so on.\n- OCP: 4 - While there are some classes that could be extended to handle different types of weapons or enemies, the overall design does not fully adhere to the Open/Closed Principle as it would require significant changes in many places when adding new features.\n- LSP: 5 - The Liskov Substitution Principle is well followed as there are no methods that break this principle. For example, all subclasses can be substituted for their superclass without causing any issues.\n- ISP: 4 - While the Interface Segregation Principle is not fully adhered to as some interfaces have multiple methods which could be segregated into smaller ones. However, it's generally good practice to follow this principle and in this case, it would require significant changes to achieve that.\n- DIP: 5 - The Dependency Inversion Principle is well followed as high level modules do not depend on low level modules but both depend on abstractions. For example, the `Enemy` class does not directly depend on a `Weapon` object but depends on an abstraction (the `IWeapon` interface).\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: NONE\n\n**NONE**\n\nThere are no significant violations of the SOLID principles in this code. The design is well-structured and adheres to all five principles. However, there could be room for improvement in terms of extensibility and maintainability by following the Open/Closed Principle more closely.", "solution_code": "NO FIX VERSION", "duration_seconds": 17.177101135253906}

They are both managing vehicles and operators, which makes them too complex and difficult to maintain or modify in the future.\n- OCP: 2 - The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is partially violated because the classes `Driver`, `Pilot`, and `Captain` all inherit from the abstract class `Operator` but they override methods that are not part of their responsibilities. This means that if we want to add a new type of operator in the future, we would have to modify these classes which violates the Open/Closed Principle.\n- LSP: 0 - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is not violated because there are no methods that can be overridden in subclasses that break the contract defined by their superclass.\n- ISP: 3 - The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is partially violated because some classes implement methods they don't need, such as `navigate_air` and `communicate_with_tower` in `Driver` class or `navigate_water` and `steer` in `Captain` class. This means that these classes are forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, which is against the Interface Segregation Principle.\n- DIP: 0 - The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is not violated because high level modules (classes `Vehicle` and `Operator`) don't depend on low level modules (concrete classes like `Driver`, `Pilot`, etc.).
