### Table: Representative Scenarios Used to Generate SOLID Violation Examples in the Dataset

| **Principle** | **Violation Scenarios** |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **SRP**       | *User Database:* A class handling both user persistence and email notifications. <br> *Salary Payslip:* An employee class calculating salary and printing pay slips. <br> *File Archiving:* A processor handling file content, archiving, and history tracking. <br> *Product Discount:* A product class applying discounts and managing display logic. |
| **OCP**       | *Payment Processing:* A processor requiring modification to add new payment methods. <br> *Customer Registration:* A service requiring changes to support new customer types. <br> *Document Notification:* A service requiring modification for new notification channels. <br> *Report Exporting:* An exporter requiring modification to add new export formats. |
| **DIP**       | *Email Service:* A service with a direct, hardcoded dependency on a `MySQLDatabase` class. <br> *Payment Processing:* A system tightly coupled to a specific `PayPalGateway`. <br> *File Processing:* A processor with hardcoded dependencies on file system operations. <br> *Notification System:* A service with a direct dependency on a `TwilioSMS` provider. |
| **LSP**       | *Vehicle Fuel System:* An `ElectricVehicle` subclass violating the expected `refuel()` behavior. <br> *Payment Processing:* A `CashProcessor` subclass improperly restricting valid payment amounts. <br> *Bird Flying Behavior:* A `Penguin` subclass breaking the inherited `fly()` contract. <br> *Document Processing:* A `ReadOnlyDocument` subclass breaking the inherited `save()` contract. |
| **ISP**       | *Game Development:* A mage class forced to implement an unused `meleeAttack()` method. <br> *Restaurant Management:* A waiter class forced to implement an irrelevant `cookFood()` method. <br> *Vehicle Control System:* A car class forced to implement an irrelevant `fly()` method. <br> *Music Player System:* A `CDPlayer` implementing a "fat" interface with unnecessary methods. |
