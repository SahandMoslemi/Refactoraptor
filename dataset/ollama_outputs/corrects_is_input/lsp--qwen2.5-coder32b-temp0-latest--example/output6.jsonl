A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O. Now it only generates the report, following SRP.\n\nHere is the code:\ninterface SimpleLogger {\n    void log(String message);\n}\n\nclass CountingLogger implements SimpleLogger {\n    private int messagesLogged = 0;\n\n    public int getMessagesLoggedCount() {\n        return messagesLogged;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void log(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"[COUNTING LOG] \" + message);\n        messagesLogged++;\n    }\n}\n\nclass SilentLogger implements SimpleLogger {\n    @Override\n    public void log(String message) {\n        // This implementation simply does nothing, which is a valid behavior\n        // for a SimpleLogger if the contract doesn't guarantee visible output.\n    }\n}", "raw_response": "**NONE**\n```java\ninterface SimpleLogger {\n    void log(String message);\n}\n\nclass CountingLogger implements SimpleLogger {\n    private int messagesLogged = 0;\n\n    public int getMessagesLoggedCount() {\n        return messagesLogged;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void log(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"[COUNTING LOG] \" + message);\n        messagesLogged++;\n    }\n}\n\nclass SilentLogger implements SimpleLogger {\n    @Override\n    public void log(String message) {\n        // This implementation simply does nothing, which is a valid behavior\n        // for a SimpleLogger if the contract doesn't guarantee visible output.\n    }\n}\n```\nThe provided code does not violate any of the SOLID principles.
