Instead of directly using the `os` module within the `RealFileProcessor` and `ReadOnlyFileStatusProvider`, a new abstract class `FileManager` is introduced. This class defines methods for file operations, which are then implemented by `OsFileManager`. Both `RealFileProcessor` and `ReadOnlyFileStatusProvider` depend on this abstraction (`FileManager`) rather than directly on the concrete implementation (`os`). This makes the code more modular and easier to test or modify in the future without changing the core logic of the processors.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "SOLID RATINGS:\n- SRP: 5 - [reasoning]: Each class has a single responsibility. `FileStatusProvider` is responsible for providing file status, `FileProcessor` is responsible for processing files, and `ReadOnlyFileStatusProvider` is responsible for read-only file status checks.\n- OCP: 4 - [reasoning]: The code is open for extension (new classes can be added that implement the interfaces) but not entirely closed for modification.
