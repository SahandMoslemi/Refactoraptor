and its implementations (`DailySalesReport`, `ProductSalesReport`, `RegionalSalesReport`) each handle a single responsibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.\n2. **OCP**: The system is open for extension (new report types can be added without modifying existing code) but closed for modification (existing code does not need to change).\n3. **LSP**: The implementations of `ReportGenerator` adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, as they all implement the same interface.\n4. **ISP**: The `ReportGenerator` interface is small and focused on a single responsibility, making it easy to use and understand.\n5. **DIP**: The `ReportFactory` class depends on abstractions (`ReportGenerator`) rather than concrete implementations, adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.\n\nBy refactoring the code into multiple classes that each handle a specific report type, we have improved the modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the system.", "violation":

It could benefit from dependency injection to make it more testable and decoupled.\n\n**MOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION:** SRP", "solution_code": "import uuid\nfrom typing import Set\n\nclass Document:\n    def __init__(self, title, content, creator):\n        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        self.title = title\n        self.content = content\n        self.creator = creator\n        self.shared_users = set()\n    \n    def get_id(self):\n        return self.id\n    \n    def get_title(self):\n        return self.title\n    \n    def get_content(self):\n        return self.content\n    \n    def get_creator(self):\n        return self.creator\n    \n    def get_shared_users(self):\n        return self.shared_users\n    \n    def add_shared_user(self, user):\n        self.shared_users.add(user)\n\nclass User:\n    def __init__(self, username, contact_info, preferred_contact_method):\n        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())\n        self.username = username\n        self.contact_info = contact_info\n        self.preferred_contact_method = preferred_contact_method\n    \n    def get_id(self):\n        return self.id\n    \n    def get_username(self):\n        return self.username\n    \n    def get_contact_info(self):\n        return self.contact_info\n    \n    def get_preferred_contact_method(self):\n        return self.preferred_contact_method\n\nclass DocumentRepository:\n    def save(self, document):\n        pass\n    \n    def update(self, document):\n        pass\n    \n    def find_by_id(self, id):\n        pass\n\nclass SecurityService:\n    def can_share_document(self, document, user):\n        pass\n\nclass Logger:\n    def log(self, message):\n        pass\n\nclass DocumentCreationService:\n    def __init__(self, repository, logger):\n        self.repository = repository\n        self.logger = logger\n    \n    def create_document(self, title, content, creator):\n        document = Document(title, content, creator)\n        self.repository.save(document)\n        self.logger.log(f\"Document created: {document.get_id()}\")\n        return document\n\nclass DocumentSharingService:\n    def __init__(self, repository, security_service, logger):\n        self.repository = repository\n        self.security_service = security_service\n        self.logger = logger\n    \n    def share_document(self, document, recipient, shared_by):\n        self.validate_sharing_permissions(document, shared_by)\n        document.add_shared_user(recipient)\n        self.repository.update(document)\n        self.logger.log(f\"Document {document.get_id()} shared with {recipient.get_username()}\")\n        self.notify_user(document, recipient, shared_by)\n    \n    def validate_sharing_permissions(self, document, user):\n        if not self.security_service.can_share_document(document, user):\n            raise SecurityError(\"User does not have permission to share this document\")\n    \n    def notify_user(self, document, recipient, shared_by):\n        recipient_contact = recipient.get_contact_info()\n        message = f\"Document '{document.get_title()}' has been shared with you by {shared_by.get_username()}\"\n        \n        #

violating ISP because it had a large interface that included methods for generating different types of documents, which could be used independently. I refactored this by creating a new class `ReportDataGenerator` that encapsulates the generation logic for each document type. This allows `ReportExporter` to depend on smaller, more specific interfaces (`ReportDataGenerator`), adhering to ISP.\n\n2. **Refactored Code**: The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original but separates concerns better by isolating the document generation logic into a separate class.

The logic for generating different types of reports (daily, product, regional) has been moved into separate private methods (`_generate_daily_report`, `_generate_product_report`, `_generate_regional_report`).

`DocumentService`. This allows for more specific implementations of notifications (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) without forcing other services to implement unnecessary methods.\n2. **Refactored Code**: A new class `EmailNotificationService`, `SMSNotificationService`, `PushNotificationService`, and `SlackNotificationService` were created to handle different types of notifications. The `DocumentService` now takes an instance of `NotificationService` as a dependency, allowing for flexibility in choosing the notification method.\n3. **SecurityServiceImpl** and **LoggerImpl** classes were added to provide concrete implementations of the `SecurityService` and `Logger` interfaces.\n\nThis refactoring adheres to the ISP principle by ensuring that each interface is focused on a single responsibility, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.", "violation": "ISP", "violation_list": ["ISP"], "explanation": "[SOLID ratings above]\n\n**ISP (Interface Segregation

Responsibility Principle (SRP) because it had multiple responsibilities: filtering content based on type and removing common profanity and personal information. By extracting each filtering logic into separate classes (`EmailContentFilter`, `SocialContentFilter`, `CommentContentFilter`) that implement a common interface (`ContentFilterStrategy`), we adhere to the SRP principle. The `ContentFilter` class now only handles the composition of these strategies and the removal of profanity and personal information, making it more focused and easier to maintain.", "violation": "SRP", "violation_list": ["SRP"], "explanation": "[SOLID ratings above]\n\n**SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**", "solution_code": "class Content(\n    private val text: String,\n    private val type: String,\n    private val metadata: Map<String, String>\n) {\n    fun getText(): String {\n        return text\n    }\n    \n    fun getType(): String {\n        return type\n    }\n    \n    fun getMetadata(): Map<String, String> {\n        return metadata\n    }\n}\n\ninterface ContentFilterStrategy {\n    fun filter(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String\n}\n\nclass EmailContentFilter : ContentFilterStrategy {\n    override fun filter(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val audience = metadata.getOrDefault(\"audience\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (audience == \"public\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)confidential:\"), \"[REDACTED]\")\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)internal use only\"), \"[INTERNAL]\")\n        }\n        \n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)from:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)to:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)cc:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        \n        return result\n    }\n}\n\nclass SocialContentFilter : ContentFilterStrategy {\n    override fun filter(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val platform = metadata.getOrDefault(\"platform\", \"general\")\n        val audience = metadata.getOrDefault(\"audience\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (platform == \"twitter\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"@([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\"), \"[USERNAME]\")\n        } else if (platform == \"facebook\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"@\\\\[[^\\\\]]+\\\\]\"), \"[NAME]\")\n        }\n        \n        if (audience == \"minor\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)alcohol|beer|wine\"), \"[AGE-RESTRICTED]\")\n        }\n        \n        return result\n    }\n}\n\nclass CommentContentFilter : ContentFilterStrategy {\n    override fun filter(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val context = metadata.getOrDefault(\"context\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (context == \"news\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)allegedly|reportedly\"), \"[STATEMENT]\")\n        } else if (context == \"review\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)terrible|awful|worst ever\"), \"not satisfactory\")\n        }\n        \n        return result\n    }\n}\n\nclass ContentFilter(private val strategies: Map<String, ContentFilterStrategy>) {\n    fun filterContent(content: Content): String {\n        var filteredText = content.getText()\n        \n        when (content.getType()) {\n            \"email\" -> filteredText = strategies[\"email\"]?.filter(filteredText, content.getMetadata()) ?: filteredText\n            \"social\" -> filteredText = strategies[\"social\"]?.filter(filteredText, content.getMetadata()) ?: filteredText\n            \"comment\" -> filteredText = strategies[\"comment\"]?.filter(filteredText, content.getMetadata()) ?: filteredText\n        }\n        \n        filteredText = removeCommonProfanity(filteredText)\n        filteredText = removePersonalInfo(filteredText)\n        \n        return filteredText\n    }\n    \n    private fun removeCommonProfanity(text: String): String {\n        return text.replace(Regex(\"(?i)badword1|badword2|badword3\"), \"[INAPPROPRIATE]\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun removePersonalInfo(text: String): String {\n        var result = text\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"\\\\d{3}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{4}\"), \"[SSN]\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"\\\\d{16}\"), \"[CREDIT_CARD]\")\n        return result\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.859221458435059}

an additional interface, `INotificationService`, which is responsible for handling user notifications.\n   - This separation allows the `DocumentService` to focus solely on document-related logic and delegate notification responsibilities to a separate service.\n\n2. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**:\n   - The `NotificationService` class handles all notification-related logic, adhering to the SRP by focusing on a single responsibility.\n\n3. **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**:\n   - The `INotificationService` interface allows for easy extension of notification methods without modifying existing code.\n\n4. **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)**:\n   - The `NotificationService` class can be easily replaced with other implementations that adhere to the `INotificationService` interface, ensuring LSP compliance.\n\n5. **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**:\n   - The `DocumentService` class depends on abstractions (`IDocumentRepository`, `ISecurityService`, `ILogger`, and `INotificationService`) rather than concrete implementations, adhering to DIP.", "violation": "ISP, SRP, OCP, LSP, DIP", "violation_list": ["ISP", "SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "DIP"], "explanation": "[SOLID

Similarly, separate interfaces (`IPdfDocument`, `IExcelDocument`) were created for generating PDF and Excel documents. This allows classes implementing these interfaces to focus on their specific responsibilities without being burdened with unrelated functionality.\n\n2. **Refactored Code**: The refactored code maintains the original structure but separates concerns more effectively by adhering to the ISP principle.

`ReportGenerator` class was violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because it had multiple responsibilities: generating different types of reports. By refactoring, we created separate classes (`DailySalesReport`, `ProductSalesReport`, and `RegionalSalesReport`) that each handle a single responsibility.

different types of content and removing common profanity and personal information. This violates the SRP because it has multiple responsibilities.\n\n2. **Refactored Code**:\n   - Created an interface `IContentFilter` with methods for filtering email, social media, and comment content, as well as removing common profanity and personal information.\n   - Implemented separate classes (`EmailFilter`, `SocialFilter`, `CommentFilter`) that implement the `IContentFilter` interface. Each class handles only one type of content filtering.\n   - Created a new class `ContentFilter` that uses instances of the specific filter classes to delegate the filtering tasks based on the content type.\n\nThis refactoring ensures that each class has a single responsibility, adhering to the SRP.", "violation": "SRP", "violation_list": ["SRP"], "explanation": "[SOLID ratings above]\n\n**SRP

However, it also contains logic for calculating the total weight of the order, which is not its primary responsibility.\n\nOCP: 2 - The class `ShippingCost` has multiple conditions to determine the shipping cost based on different methods (standard, express, overnight, international). This makes the class difficult to extend without modifying existing code.\n\nLSP: 3 - The class hierarchy does not follow LSP. For example, if a subclass of `ShippingMethod` overrides a method that is essential for calculating shipping costs, it could break the contract and lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nISP: 2 - The interface `IShippingMethod` has methods like `CalculateCost`, but it also includes properties like `BaseCost` which are not relevant to all shipping methods.

This adheres to ISP as it requires subclasses to implement only the necessary members. The `OrderCalculator` and `DistanceCalculator` classes provide the required functionality for calculating the total weight and distance, respectively.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "SRP: 3 - The class `ShippingCost` calculates shipping costs based on various factors. However, it also contains logic for calculating the total weight of the order, which is not its primary responsibility.\n\nOCP: 2 - The class `ShippingCost` has multiple conditions to determine the shipping cost based on different methods (standard, express, overnight, international). This makes the class difficult to extend without modifying existing code.\n\nLSP: 3 - The class hierarchy does not follow LSP. For example, if a subclass of `ShippingMethod` overrides a method that is essential for calculating shipping costs, it could break the contract and lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nISP: 2 - The interface `IShippingMethod` has methods like `CalculateCost`, but it also includes properties like `BaseCost` which are not relevant to all shipping methods. This violates ISP as it requires subclasses to implement unnecessary members.\n\nDIP: 3 - The class `ShippingCost` directly depends on concrete classes for calculating the total weight of the order and determining the distance.
