The `AreaCalculator` class is not open to new types of shapes, as it only calculates the area of rectangles and circles.

The `Shape` class and the `AreaCalculator` class both violate the ISP, as they are not specific enough in their responsibilities.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class AreaCalculator {\n    public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {\n        if (shape.getType().equals(\"rectangle\")) {\n            Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;\n            return rectangle.getWidth() * rectangle.getHeight();\n        } else if (shape.getType().equals(\"circle\")) {\n            Circle circle = (Circle) shape;\n            return Math.PI * circle.getRadius() * circle.getRadius();\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it is not a good idea to have a class that has a direct dependency on its dependencies, such as the `AreaCalculator` class having a direct dependency on the `Shape` class. The `AreaCalculator` class also violates the DIP by having a hard-coded dependency on the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes.\n\n**Refactoring:**\nTo fix the violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can introduce an interface for the shapes that the `AreaCalculator` class depends on. This will allow us to decouple the `AreaCalculator` class from the specific implementation of the shapes and make it more flexible in its dependencies.\n```java\npublic interface Shape {\n    double getWidth();\n    double getHeight();\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle implements Shape {\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n    \n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double getWidth() {\n        return width;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double getHeight() {\n        return height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle implements Shape {\n    private double radius;\n    \n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double getRadius() {\n        return radius;\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the `AreaCalculator` class can depend on the `Shape` interface instead of depending directly on the `Rectangle` and `Circle` classes. This will allow us to decouple the `AreaCalculator` class from its dependencies and make it more flexible in its design.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Shape {\n    private String type;\n    \n    public Shape(String type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n    \n    public String getType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle extends Shape {\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n    \n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        super(\"rectangle\");\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n    \n    public double getWidth() {\n        return width;\n    }\n    \n    public double getHeight() {\n        return height;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle extends Shape {\n    private double radius;\n    \n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        super(\"circle\");\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    \n    public double getRadius() {\n        return radius;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 10.69586181640625}

The `calculateDamage` method is only relevant for warriors and mages, but it is also called on other types of characters that do not have a damage value.

The `calculateMaxSpeed` method is hardcoded to handle only two specific types of vehicles: cars and bicycles. If a new type of vehicle is added, this method will need to be modified, which violates the principle of being closed for modification.\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class SpeedCalculator {\n    public double calculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle) {\n        if (vehicle instanceof Car) {\n            return ((Car) vehicle).getHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        } else if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {\n            return ((Bicycle) vehicle).getGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable for its parent class. The `calculateMaxSpeed` method assumes that the input parameter is a `Vehicle`, but it does not work with any other type of vehicle, such as an electric car or a motorcycle. This violates the principle of being substitutable for its parent class.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic class SpeedCalculator {\n    public double calculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle) {\n        if (vehicle instanceof Car) {\n            return ((Car) vehicle).getHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        } else if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {\n            return ((Bicycle) vehicle).getGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains multiple methods that are not relevant to each other. The `calculateMaxSpeed` method is only concerned with calculating the maximum speed of a vehicle, but it also needs to handle other methods such as `getType()` and `toString()`. These methods are not related to the responsibility of calculating the maximum speed, and they should be separated into their own interfaces.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class SpeedCalculator {\n    public double calculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle) {\n        if (vehicle instanceof Car) {\n            return ((Car) vehicle).getHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        } else if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {\n            return ((Bicycle) vehicle).getGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hardcoded dependency on the `Vehicle` interface, which is not abstract enough to be used as a dependency. The `calculateMaxSpeed` method needs to work with any type of vehicle, but it only works with two specific types: cars and bicycles. This violates the principle of depending on abstractions rather than concretions.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create separate classes for each type of vehicle and implement the `calculateMaxSpeed` method in each class. For example:\n```java\npublic class Car {\n    private int horsePower;\n    \n    public Car(int horsePower) {\n        this.horsePower = horsePower;\n    }\n    \n    public double calculateMaxSpeed() {\n        return horsePower * 0.4;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Bicycle {\n    private int gearCount;\n    \n    public Bicycle(int gearCount) {\n        this.gearCount = gearCount;\n    }\n    \n    public double calculateMaxSpeed() {\n        return gearCount * 5.0;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SpeedCalculator {\n    public double calculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle) {\n        if (vehicle instanceof Car) {\n            return ((Car) vehicle).calculateMaxSpeed();\n        } else if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {\n            return ((Bicycle) vehicle).calculateMaxSpeed();\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this refactored code, we have created separate classes for each type of vehicle and implemented the `calculateMaxSpeed` method in each class. This allows us to use the `Vehicle` interface as a dependency, which is more abstract and easier to change in the future.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class SpeedCalculator {\n    public double calculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle) {\n        if (vehicle.getType().equals(\"car\")) {\n            Car car = (Car) vehicle;\n            return car.getHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        } else if (vehicle.getType().equals(\"bicycle\")) {\n            Bicycle bicycle = (Bicycle) vehicle;\n            return bicycle.getGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.990238428115845}

The `FileSystemWriter` interface has a single responsibility: writing files to a file system. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n**OCP**\n```java\npublic class ReportExporter {\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n    private FileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporter(DataSource dataSource, FileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n    \n    public ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `exportReport` method is tightly coupled with the `generateReportData` method, which makes it difficult to add new export formats without modifying the existing code.\n\nTo fix this, we can extract an interface for each export format and have the `ReportExporter` class implement them:\n```java\npublic interface ReportExporter {\n    ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination);\n}\n\npublic interface PdfExportFormat {\n    byte[] generatePdfData(Report report);\n}\n\npublic interface ExcelExportFormat {\n    byte[] generateExcelData(Report report);\n}\n\npublic class ReportExporterImpl implements ReportExporter, PdfExportFormat, ExcelExportFormat {\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n    private FileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporterImpl(DataSource dataSource, FileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public byte[] generatePdfData(Report report) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public byte[] generateExcelData(Report report) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nNow the `ReportExporter` class is open for extension (new export formats can be added without modifying the existing code) and closed for modification (the existing code is not modified to support new export formats).\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class ReportExporter {\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n    private FileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporter(DataSource dataSource, FileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n    \n    public ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable for its parent class. The `exportReport` method returns an `ExportResult` object, which is a custom type that is specific to this class. If we want to use this class in a different context where we need to return a more general result (e.g., a boolean value indicating whether the export was successful), we would have to modify the code to return the correct type of result.\n\nTo fix this, we can extract an interface for each export format and have the `ReportExporter` class implement them:\n```java\npublic interface ReportExporter {\n    ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination);\n}\n\npublic interface PdfExportFormat {\n    boolean exportPdf(Report report, String destination);\n}\n\npublic interface ExcelExportFormat {\n    boolean exportExcel(Report report, String destination);\n}\n\npublic class ReportExporterImpl implements ReportExporter, PdfExportFormat, ExcelExportFormat {\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n    private FileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporterImpl(DataSource dataSource, FileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean exportPdf(Report report, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean exportExcel(Report report, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nNow the `ReportExporter` class is substitutable for its parent class (we can use it in a different context where we need to return a more general result).", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class ReportExporter {\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n    private FileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporter(DataSource dataSource, FileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n    \n    public ExportResult exportReport(String reportId, String exportFormat, String destination) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 10.258063316345215}

It is responsible for generating reports of different types (daily, product, regional), which makes it difficult to understand and maintain.\n\n**OCP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport(String reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension but closed for modification. If a new type of report needs to be added (e.g., \"customer\"), the class will need to be modified, which goes against the principle of being open for extension.\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport(String reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable for its parent class. The `generateReport` method returns a `String`, which is not a subclass of `Object`. This makes it difficult to use the `ReportGenerator` class in a polymorphic way, as it cannot be used with other classes that expect a `String` return type.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport(String reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a large interface with many methods that are not relevant to its implementation. The `generateReport` method is the only method that is actually implemented, but it still has many other methods that do not have any implementation. This makes the interface difficult to use and understand.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport(String reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a high level of coupling with its dependencies. The `SalesData` class is a dependency of the `ReportGenerator` class, and it is tightly coupled to the `Sale` class. This makes it difficult to change the implementation of either class without affecting the other.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create a separate class for each type of report (e.g., `DailyReport`, `ProductReport`, `RegionalReport`) and make them implement a common interface (`IReport`). This will allow us to use polymorphism to generate reports of different types without modifying the `ReportGenerator` class.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```java\npublic interface IReport {\n    String generateReport(SalesData data);\n}\n\npublic class DailyReport implements IReport {\n    @Override\n    public String generateReport(SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ProductReport implements IReport {\n    @Override\n    public String generateReport(SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\npublic class RegionalReport implements IReport {\n    @Override\n    public String generateReport(SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the `ReportGenerator` class can use polymorphism to generate reports of different types without modifying its implementation:\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    private IReport report;\n    \n    public ReportGenerator(IReport report) {\n        this.report = report;\n    }\n    \n    public String generateReport(SalesData data) {\n        return report.generateReport(data);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will allow us to use the `ReportGenerator` class in a polymorphic way, without modifying its implementation.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport(String reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 6.441778659820557}

The class is also not open for extension, as new types of content may require additional filtering rules, but the class does not provide any mechanism for adding them.\n\n**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\n```java\npublic interface ContentFilter {\n    String filter(Content content);\n}\n\npublic class EmailContentFilter implements ContentFilter {\n    @Override\n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        // Filter email content\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SocialMediaContentFilter implements ContentFilter {\n    @Override\n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        // Filter social media content\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CommentContentFilter implements ContentFilter {\n    @Override\n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        // Filter comment content\n    }\n}\n```\nThis interface segregation principle is violated because the `ContentFilter` interface has a lot of methods that are not relevant to all implementations. For example, the `EmailContentFilter` and `SocialMediaContentFilter` classes only need to implement the `filter(Content content)` method, but they also have to implement other methods that are not used in their implementation. This can lead to unnecessary code duplication and make the interface harder to understand and maintain.\n\n**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\n```java\npublic class ContentFilter {\n    private final EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter;\n    private final SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter;\n    private final CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter;\n    \n    public ContentFilter(EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter, SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter, CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter) {\n        this.emailContentFilter = emailContentFilter;\n        this.socialMediaContentFilter = socialMediaContentFilter;\n        this.commentContentFilter = commentContentFilter;\n    }\n    \n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        if (content instanceof EmailContent) {\n            return emailContentFilter.filter((EmailContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof SocialMediaContent) {\n            return socialMediaContentFilter.filter((SocialMediaContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof CommentContent) {\n            return commentContentFilter.filter((CommentContent) content);\n        }\n        \n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported content type: \" + content.getClass().getName());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `EmailContentFilter`, `SocialMediaContentFilter`, and `CommentContentFilter` classes, which are not abstracted away through an interface. This makes it difficult to change or replace these dependencies without affecting the codebase.\n\n**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\n```java\npublic class ContentFilter {\n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        if (content instanceof EmailContent) {\n            return filterEmailContent((EmailContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof SocialMediaContent) {\n            return filterSocialMediaContent((SocialMediaContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof CommentContent) {\n            return filterCommentContent((CommentContent) content);\n        }\n        \n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported content type: \" + content.getClass().getName());\n    }\n    \n    private String filterEmailContent(EmailContent emailContent) {\n        // Filter email content\n    }\n    \n    private String filterSocialMediaContent(SocialMediaContent socialMediaContent) {\n        // Filter social media content\n    }\n    \n    private String filterCommentContent(CommentContent commentContent) {\n        // Filter comment content\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities, which are filtering email content, social media content, and comment content. This makes it difficult to understand and maintain the codebase, as well as making it harder to test and debug the code.\n\n**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**\n```java\npublic class ContentFilter {\n    private final EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter;\n    private final SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter;\n    private final CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter;\n    \n    public ContentFilter(EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter, SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter, CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter) {\n        this.emailContentFilter = emailContentFilter;\n        this.socialMediaContentFilter = socialMediaContentFilter;\n        this.commentContentFilter = commentContentFilter;\n    }\n    \n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        if (content instanceof EmailContent) {\n            return emailContentFilter.filter((EmailContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof SocialMediaContent) {\n            return socialMediaContentFilter.filter((SocialMediaContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof CommentContent) {\n            return commentContentFilter.filter((CommentContent) content);\n        }\n        \n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported content type: \" + content.getClass().getName());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension, as new types of content may require additional filtering rules, but the class does not provide any mechanism for adding them. This makes it difficult to add new features or modify existing ones without affecting the codebase.\n\n**Law of Demeter (LoD)**\n```java\npublic class ContentFilter {\n    private final EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter;\n    private final SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter;\n    private final CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter;\n    \n    public ContentFilter(EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter, SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter, CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter) {\n        this.emailContentFilter = emailContentFilter;\n        this.socialMediaContentFilter = socialMediaContentFilter;\n        this.commentContentFilter = commentContentFilter;\n    }\n    \n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        if (content instanceof EmailContent) {\n            return emailContentFilter.filter((EmailContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof SocialMediaContent) {\n            return socialMediaContentFilter.filter((SocialMediaContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof CommentContent) {\n            return commentContentFilter.filter((CommentContent) content);\n        }\n        \n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported content type: \" + content.getClass().getName());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Law of Demeter because it has a hard dependency on the `EmailContentFilter`, `SocialMediaContentFilter`, and `CommentContentFilter` classes, which are not abstracted away through an interface. This makes it difficult to change or replace these dependencies without affecting the codebase.\n\n**Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**\n```java\npublic class ContentFilter {\n    private final EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter;\n    private final SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter;\n    private final CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter;\n    \n    public ContentFilter(EmailContentFilter emailContentFilter, SocialMediaContentFilter socialMediaContentFilter, CommentContentFilter commentContentFilter) {\n        this.emailContentFilter = emailContentFilter;\n        this.socialMediaContentFilter = socialMediaContentFilter;\n        this.commentContentFilter = commentContentFilter;\n    }\n    \n    public String filter(Content content) {\n        if (content instanceof EmailContent) {\n            return emailContentFilter.filter((EmailContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof SocialMediaContent) {\n            return socialMediaContentFilter.filter((SocialMediaContent) content);\n        } else if (content instanceof CommentContent) {\n            return commentContentFilter.filter((CommentContent) content);\n        }\n        \n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported content type: \" + content.getClass().getName());\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the DRY principle because it has a lot of duplicate code, as all three filtering methods have similar logic.

It is responsible for both representing a vehicle and calculating its maximum speed. This makes it difficult to change or maintain the code, as any changes to one responsibility may affect the other.\n\n**OCP**\n```python\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type):\n        self.__type = type\n    \n    def get_type(self):\n        return self.__type\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, horse_power):\n        super().__init__(\"car\")\n        self.__horse_power = horse_power\n    \n    def get_horse_power(self):\n        return self.__horse_power\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, gear_count):\n        super().__init__(\"bicycle\")\n        self.__gear_count = gear_count\n    \n    def get_gear_count(self):\n        return self.__gear_count\n```\nThis class violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. If we wanted to add a new type of vehicle, such as an electric car, we would need to modify the existing code to accommodate this new type. This makes it difficult to extend the code without breaking its current functionality.\n\n**LSP**\n```python\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type):\n        self.__type = type\n    \n    def get_type(self):\n        return self.__type\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, horse_power):\n        super().__init__(\"car\")\n        self.__horse_power = horse_power\n    \n    def get_horse_power(self):\n        return self.__horse_power\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, gear_count):\n        super().__init__(\"bicycle\")\n        self.__gear_count = gear_count\n    \n    def get_gear_count(self):\n        return self.__gear_count\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not follow the principle of substitutability. If we have a method that expects a `Vehicle` object as an argument, and we pass in a `Car` or `Bicycle` object instead, the method may behave unexpectedly. This makes it difficult to use the class in a polymorphic way.\n\n**ISP**\n```python\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type):\n        self.__type = type\n    \n    def get_type(self):\n        return self.__type\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, horse_power):\n        super().__init__(\"car\")\n        self.__horse_power = horse_power\n    \n    def get_horse_power(self):\n        return self.__horse_power\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, gear_count):\n        super().__init__(\"bicycle\")\n        self.__gear_count = gear_count\n    \n    def get_gear_count(self):\n        return self.__gear_count\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains multiple methods that are not relevant to all clients. This makes it difficult to use the class in a modular way, as some clients may only need to access a subset of the methods provided by the interface.\n\n**DIP**\n```python\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type):\n        self.__type = type\n    \n    def get_type(self):\n        return self.__type\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, horse_power):\n        super().__init__(\"car\")\n        self.__horse_power = horse_power\n    \n    def get_horse_power(self):\n        return self.__horse_power\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, gear_count):\n        super().__init__(\"bicycle\")\n        self.__gear_count = gear_count\n    \n    def get_gear_count(self):\n        return self.__gear_count\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `Vehicle` interface, which may change over time. This makes it difficult to maintain the code in the long term, as any changes to the `Vehicle` interface will require modifications to the dependent classes.\n\n**Refactoring:**\nTo fix this violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can introduce an abstraction layer between the dependent classes and the `Vehicle` interface. This will allow us to change the implementation of the `Vehicle` interface without affecting the dependent classes.\n```python\nclass Vehicle:\n    def __init__(self, type):\n        self.__type = type\n    \n    def get_type(self):\n        return self.__type\n\nclass Car(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, horse_power):\n        super().__init__(\"car\")\n        self.__horse_power = horse_power\n    \n    def get_horse_power(self):\n        return self.__horse_power\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def __init__(self, gear_count):\n        super().__init__(\"bicycle\")\n        self.__gear_count = gear_count\n    \n    def get_gear_count(self):\n        return self.__gear_count\n\nclass VehicleRepository:\n    def __init__(self, vehicle_factory):\n        self.vehicle_factory = vehicle_factory\n    \n    def create_vehicle(self, type, horse_power=None, gear_count=None):\n        if type == \"car\":\n            return self.vehicle_factory.create_car(horse_power)\n        elif type == \"bicycle\":\n            return self.vehicle_factory.create_bicycle(gear_count)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid vehicle type\")\n```\nIn this refactored version, we have introduced an abstraction layer between the dependent classes and the `Vehicle` interface. The `VehicleRepository` class takes a `vehicle_factory` as a dependency, which is used to create instances of the `Vehicle` interface.

The class has a lot of hardcoded tax rates, which makes it difficult to add new tax rates or modify existing ones without modifying the source code. To make this class more flexible and easier to maintain, we can use a database or a configuration file to store the tax rates, and then retrieve them dynamically at runtime.

To make this class more flexible and easier to maintain, we can use inheritance to create a base class that calculates taxes for a specific country or province, and then create subclasses for each country or province that override the `calculate_tax` method to provide customized tax calculation logic. This will allow us to avoid duplicated code and make the class more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n**DIP**\n```python\nclass TaxCalculator:\n    def __init__(self, tax_rates):\n        self.tax_rates = tax_rates\n    \n    def calculate_tax(self, order):\n        total_tax = 0.0\n        \n        for item in order.get_items():\n            item_price = item.get_price() * item.get_quantity()\n            tax_rate = self.tax_rates.get(item.get_category(), 0.0)\n            total_tax += item_price * tax_rate\n        \n        return total_tax\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hardcoded dependency on the `TaxRates` class, which makes it difficult to change or replace the tax rates without modifying the source code. To make this class more flexible and easier to maintain, we can use dependency injection to provide the tax rates as an argument to the constructor, rather than hardcoding them in the class. This will allow us to change or replace the tax rates at runtime without modifying the source code of the class.\n\n**Interface Segregation Principle**\n```python\nclass TaxCalculator:\n    def __init__(self, tax_rates):\n        self.tax_rates = tax_rates\n    \n    def calculate_tax(self, order):\n        total_tax = 0.0\n        \n        for item in order.get_items():\n            item_price = item.get_price() * item.get_quantity()\n            tax_rate = self.tax_rates.get(item.get_category(), 0.0)\n            total_tax += item_price * tax_rate\n        \n        return total_tax\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that is used by all clients, even though some clients may only need to use a subset of the functionality provided by the interface. To make this class more flexible and easier to maintain, we can use interface segregation to create separate interfaces for different types of tax rates, and then provide separate implementations for each interface. This will allow us to reduce the complexity of the interface and make it more modular and easier to maintain.\n\n**DRY**\n```python\nclass TaxCalculator:\n    def __init__(self, tax_rates):\n        self.tax_rates = tax_rates\n    \n    def calculate_tax(self, order):\n        total_tax = 0.0\n        \n        for item in order.get_items():\n            item_price = item.get_price() * item.get_quantity()\n            tax_rate = self.tax_rates.get(item.get_category(), 0.0)\n            total_tax += item_price * tax_rate\n        \n        return total_tax\n```\nThis class violates the Don't Repeat Yourself principle because it has a lot of duplicated code for calculating taxes for different items. To make this class more flexible and easier to maintain, we can use abstraction to create a base class that calculates taxes for a specific item category, and then create subclasses for each item category that override the `calculate_tax` method to provide customized tax calculation logic.

The `processPayment` method in this class is an example of an interface that is too big and contains many unrelated methods, which makes it difficult for clients to use the class without having access to unnecessary functionality.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\npublic class PaymentProcessor {\n    fun processPayment(paymentType: String, amount: Double) {\n        when (paymentType) {\n            \"creditCard\" -> processCreditCardPayment(amount)\n            \"paypal\" -> processPaypalPayment(amount)\n            \"bankTransfer\" -> processBankTransferPayment(amount)\n            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported payment type\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun processCreditCardPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing credit card payment of $${amount}\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun processPaypalPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun processBankTransferPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing bank transfer of $${amount}\")\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hardcoded dependency on the `println` function, which makes it difficult to test and reuse the code. The `processPayment` method in this class is an example of a class that is tightly coupled with the `println` function, which makes it difficult to separate the concerns of the class and make it more modular and reusable.\n\n**Refactoring:**\nTo fix these violations, we can refactor the code to follow the SOLID principles. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Extract an interface for each payment type (e.g., `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, `BankTransferPayment`) and have the `processPayment` method take an instance of one of these interfaces as a parameter. This will allow clients to use the class without having access to unnecessary functionality.\n2. Use dependency injection to provide the `println` function as a dependency, rather than hardcoding it in the class. This will make it easier to test and reuse the code.\n3. Use polymorphism to handle different payment types in a more modular way. For example, we could have a base class for payments that has a virtual method for processing payments, and then have subclasses for each type of payment that override this method with specific logic for handling their respective payment types. This will make it easier to add new payment types without modifying the existing code.\n4. Use a factory pattern to create instances of the appropriate payment class based on the payment type. This will allow clients to use the class without having to know the details of how payments are processed, and will make it easier to add new payment types without modifying the existing code.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class PaymentProcessor {\n    fun processPayment(paymentType: String, amount: Double) {\n        when (paymentType) {\n            \"creditCard\" -> processCreditCardPayment(amount)\n            \"paypal\" -> processPaypalPayment(amount)\n            \"bankTransfer\" -> processBankTransferPayment(amount)\n            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported payment type\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun processCreditCardPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing credit card payment of $${amount}\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun processPaypalPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing PayPal payment of $${amount}\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun processBankTransferPayment(amount: Double) {\n        println(\"Processing bank transfer of $${amount}\")\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 11.772172212600708}

The `registerCustomer` method is responsible for both creating a new customer and sending a welcome email based on the customer type. This makes the code harder to understand and maintain, as it requires knowledge of both customer creation and email sending in order to understand how the method works.\n\n**OCP**\n```kotlin\nclass CustomerService(private val repository: CustomerRepository, private val emailService: EmailService) {\n    \n    fun registerCustomer(name: String, email: String, customerType: String): Customer {\n        validateCustomerData(name, email)\n        \n        val customer = Customer(name, email)\n        repository.save(customer)\n        \n        return customer\n    }\n    \n    private fun validateCustomerData(name: String, email: String) {\n        if (name.isBlank()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Name cannot be empty\")\n        }\n        \n        if (email.isBlank() || !email.matches(Regex(\"^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$\"))) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid email format\")\n        }\n        \n        if (repository.findByEmail(email) != null) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Email already registered\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `registerCustomer` method is hardcoded to send a welcome email based on the customer type, which makes it difficult to extend the functionality of the class without modifying its source code.\n\n**LSP**\n```kotlin\nclass CustomerService(private val repository: CustomerRepository, private val emailService: EmailService) {\n    \n    fun registerCustomer(name: String, email: String, customerType: String): Customer {\n        validateCustomerData(name, email)\n        \n        val customer = Customer(name, email)\n        repository.save(customer)\n        \n        return customer\n    }\n    \n    private fun validateCustomerData(name: String, email: String) {\n        if (name.isBlank()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Name cannot be empty\")\n        }\n        \n        if (email.isBlank() || !email.matches(Regex(\"^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$\"))) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid email format\")\n        }\n        \n        if (repository.findByEmail(email) != null) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Email already registered\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable for its parent class. The `validateCustomerData` method in the `CustomerService` class throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the email is already registered, which makes it difficult to use the class as a base class for other services that may have different validation requirements.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\nclass CustomerService(private val repository: CustomerRepository, private val emailService: EmailService) {\n    \n    fun registerCustomer(name: String, email: String, customerType: String): Customer {\n        validateCustomerData(name, email)\n        \n        val customer = Customer(name, email)\n        repository.save(customer)\n        \n        return customer\n    }\n    \n    private fun validateCustomerData(name: String, email: String) {\n        if (name.isBlank()) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Name cannot be empty\")\n        }\n        \n        if (email.isBlank() || !email.matches(Regex(\"^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$\"))) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Invalid email format\")\n        }\n        \n        if (repository.findByEmail(email) != null) {\n            throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Email already registered\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hardcoded dependency on the `CustomerRepository` and `EmailService` classes, which makes it difficult to test the class without mocking these dependencies.

creating documents, sharing documents with users, and sending notifications to users. This is not a good design as it violates the single responsibility principle. A class should have only one reason to change. In this case, if we need to change the way we send notifications, we would need to make changes to multiple methods in the class.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can extract each responsibility into its own class. For example:\n```kotlin\nclass DocumentService(\n    private val repository: DocumentRepository,\n    private val securityService: SecurityService,\n    private val logger: Logger\n) {\n    \n    fun createDocument(title: String, content: String, creator: User): Document {\n        val document = Document(title, content, creator)\n        repository.save(document)\n        logger.log(\"Document created: ${document.getId()}\")\n        return document\n    }\n    \n    fun shareDocument(document: Document, recipient: User, sharedBy: User) {\n        validateSharingPermissions(document, sharedBy)\n        document.addSharedUser(recipient)\n        repository.update(document)\n        logger.log(\"Document ${document.getId()} shared with ${recipient.getUsername()}\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun validateSharingPermissions(document: Document, user: User) {\n        if (!securityService.canShareDocument(document, user)) {\n            throw SecurityException(\"User does not have permission to share this document\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have extracted the responsibility of creating documents and sharing documents into separate classes. The `DocumentService` class is now responsible for managing the lifecycle of documents, while the `NotificationService` class is responsible for sending notifications to users. This design follows the single responsibility principle as each class has only one reason to change.", "violation": "SRP", "violation_list": ["SRP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class DocumentService(\n    private val repository: DocumentRepository,\n    private val securityService: SecurityService,\n    private val logger: Logger\n) {\n    \n    fun createDocument(title: String, content: String, creator: User): Document {\n        val document = Document(title, content, creator)\n        repository.save(document)\n        logger.log(\"Document created: ${document.getId()}\")\n        return document\n    }\n    \n    fun shareDocument(document: Document, recipient: User, sharedBy: User) {\n        validateSharingPermissions(document, sharedBy)\n        document.addSharedUser(recipient)\n        repository.update(document)\n        logger.log(\"Document ${document.getId()} shared with ${recipient.getUsername()}\")\n        notifyUser(document, recipient, sharedBy)\n    }\n    \n    private fun validateSharingPermissions(document: Document, user: User) {\n        if (!securityService.canShareDocument(document, user)) {\n            throw SecurityException(\"User does not have permission to share this document\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun notifyUser(document: Document, recipient: User, sharedBy: User) {\n        val recipientContact = recipient.getContactInfo()\n        val message = \"Document '${document.getTitle()}' has been shared with you by ${sharedBy.getUsername()}\"\n        \n        // Notification logic based on recipient's preferred contact method\n        val contactType = recipient.getPreferredContactMethod()\n        \n        when (contactType) {\n            \"email\" -> sendEmail(recipientContact, \"Document Shared\", message)\n            \"sms\" -> sendSMS(recipientContact, message)\n            \"push\" -> sendPushNotification(recipientContact, \"Document Shared\", message)\n            \"slack\" -> sendSlackMessage(recipientContact, message)\n            else -> logger.log(\"Unknown contact method: $contactType\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun sendEmail(email: String, subject: String, message: String) {\n        println(\"Sending email to $email\")\n        println(\"Subject: $subject\")\n        println(\"Message: $message\")\n        // Email sending logic would go here\n    }\n    \n    private fun sendSMS(phoneNumber: String, message: String) {\n        println(\"Sending SMS to $phoneNumber\")\n        println(\"Message: $message\")\n        // SMS sending logic would go here\n    }\n    \n    private fun sendPushNotification(deviceId: String, title: String, message: String) {\n        println(\"Sending push notification to device $deviceId\")\n        println(\"Title: $title\")\n        println(\"Message: $message\")\n        // Push notification logic would go here\n    }\n    \n    private fun sendSlackMessage(slackUserId: String, message: String) {\n        println(\"Sending Slack message to $slackUserId\")\n        println(\"Message: $message\")\n        // Slack messaging logic would go here\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.172591924667358}

The `exportReport` method returns an `ExportResult` object, which is a complex data structure that contains information about the export process. However, this class does not provide any way to access or manipulate this data structure, which makes it difficult to use in a polymorphic manner.\n\n**ISP**\n```kotlin\nclass ReportExporter(private val dataSource: DataSource, private val fileSystem: FileSystem) {\n    \n    fun exportReport(reportId: String, exportFormat: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it implements an interface that is too broad. The `DataSource` and `FileSystem` interfaces are both very large and contain many methods that are not relevant to this class. This makes the class difficult to maintain and can lead to confusion about which methods are actually used.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\nclass ReportExporter(private val dataSource: DataSource, private val fileSystem: FileSystem) {\n    \n    fun exportReport(reportId: String, exportFormat: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `DataSource` and `FileSystem` interfaces. This makes it difficult to change the implementation of these dependencies without breaking the code.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this, we can refactor the class to use composition instead of inheritance. We can create separate classes for each export format (e.g., `PdfExporter`, `ExcelExporter`, etc.) and have them implement a common interface that defines the `exportReport` method. This will allow us to add new export formats without modifying the existing code.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```kotlin\ninterface ExportFormat {\n    fun exportReport(reportId: String, destination: String): ExportResult\n}\n\nclass PdfExporter : ExportFormat {\n    override fun exportReport(reportId: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass ExcelExporter : ExportFormat {\n    override fun exportReport(reportId: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass ReportExporter(private val dataSource: DataSource, private val fileSystem: FileSystem) {\n    \n    fun exportReport(reportId: String, exportFormat: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        return when (exportFormat) {\n            \"pdf\" -> PdfExporter().exportReport(reportId, destination)\n            \"excel\" -> ExcelExporter().exportReport(reportId, destination)\n            else -> throw IllegalArgumentException(\"Unsupported export format\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have created separate classes for each export format and have them implement a common interface that defines the `exportReport` method. This allows us to add new export formats without modifying the existing code. The `ReportExporter` class is now responsible for selecting the appropriate exporter based on the requested export format and delegating the export process to it.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class ReportExporter(private val dataSource: DataSource, private val fileSystem: FileSystem) {\n    \n    fun exportReport(reportId: String, exportFormat: String, destination: String): ExportResult {\n        // ...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 7.498737573623657}

The `generateReport` method is the only method in this class that is relevant to its clients, but it has a lot of other methods that are not needed.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\nclass ReportGenerator {\n    fun generateReport(reportType: String, data: SalesData): String {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `SalesData` class. The `generateReport` method is tightly coupled with the `SalesData` class, which makes it difficult to change or replace the `SalesData` class without affecting the `ReportGenerator` class.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create separate classes for each report type (daily, product, regional) and make them inherit from a common interface. This will allow us to add new report types without changing the existing code.\n\nHere is an example of how the refactored code could look like:\n```kotlin\ninterface Report {\n    fun generateReport(data: SalesData): String\n}\n\nclass DailyReport : Report {\n    override fun generateReport(data: SalesData): String {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass ProductReport : Report {\n    override fun generateReport(data: SalesData): String {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\nclass RegionalReport : Report {\n    override fun generateReport(data: SalesData): String {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have created separate classes for each report type and made them inherit from a common interface. This will allow us to add new report types without changing the existing code. The `generateReport` method in each class will be responsible for generating its respective report.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class ReportGenerator {\n    fun generateReport(reportType: String, data: SalesData): String {\n        // ...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 5.706902027130127}

single method `filterContent` that takes a `Content` object as input and returns the filtered text. The method first checks the type of the content, and then applies different filters depending on the type. For example, if the content is an email, it will apply the `filterEmailContent` filter. If the content is social media, it will apply the `filterSocialContent` filter.\n\nThe class also has two private methods for removing common profanity and personal information from the text. These methods are not exposed to the outside world and are only used internally by the `filterContent` method.\n\nThis design allows you to easily add new filters or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the codebase. For example, if you want to add a filter for filtering out sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers, you can simply add a new private method and call it from within the `filterContent` method.\n\nHowever, this design also has some drawbacks. For example, it makes the class harder to test because it has so many dependencies on other methods. Additionally, it can make the code harder to understand because there are so many different filters being applied in a single method.", "violation": "SRP", "violation_list": ["SRP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class ContentFilter {\n    fun filterContent(content: Content): String {\n        var filteredText = content.getText()\n        \n        if (content.getType() == \"email\") {\n            filteredText = filterEmailContent(filteredText, content.getMetadata())\n            \n        } else if (content.getType() == \"social\") {\n            filteredText = filterSocialContent(filteredText, content.getMetadata())\n            \n        } else if (content.getType() == \"comment\") {\n            filteredText = filterCommentContent(filteredText, content.getMetadata())\n        }\n        \n        filteredText = removeCommonProfanity(filteredText)\n        filteredText = removePersonalInfo(filteredText)\n        \n        return filteredText\n    }\n    \n    private fun filterEmailContent(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val audience = metadata.getOrDefault(\"audience\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (audience == \"public\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)confidential:\"), \"[REDACTED]\")\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)internal use only\"), \"[INTERNAL]\")\n        }\n        \n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)from:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)to:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)cc:\\s.*?\\n\"), \"\")\n        \n        return result\n    }\n    \n    private fun filterSocialContent(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val platform = metadata.getOrDefault(\"platform\", \"general\")\n        val audience = metadata.getOrDefault(\"audience\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (platform == \"twitter\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"@([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\"), \"[USERNAME]\")\n        } else if (platform == \"facebook\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"@\\\\[[^\\\\]]+\\\\]\"), \"[NAME]\")\n        }\n        \n        if (audience == \"minor\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)alcohol|beer|wine\"), \"[AGE-RESTRICTED]\")\n        }\n        \n        return result\n    }\n    \n    private fun filterCommentContent(text: String, metadata: Map<String, String>): String {\n        var result = text\n        val context = metadata.getOrDefault(\"context\", \"general\")\n        \n        if (context == \"news\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)allegedly|reportedly\"), \"[STATEMENT]\")\n        } else if (context == \"review\") {\n            result = result.replace(Regex(\"(?i)terrible|awful|worst ever\"), \"not satisfactory\")\n        }\n        \n        return result\n    }\n    \n    private fun removeCommonProfanity(text: String): String {\n        return text.replace(Regex(\"(?i)badword1|badword2|badword3\"), \"[INAPPROPRIATE]\")\n    }\n    \n    private fun removePersonalInfo(text: String): String {\n        var result = text\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"\\\\d{3}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{4}\"), \"[SSN]\")\n        result = result.replace(Regex(\"\\\\d{16}\"), \"[CREDIT_CARD]\")\n        return result\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.006335258483887}

The `CalculateArea()` method in the `Shape` class returns a value that depends on the shape's type, and if a `Circle` object is passed to the method, it will return an incorrect result.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IRectangle {\n    double GetWidth();\n    double GetHeight();\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : IRectangle {\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n    \n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n    \n    public double GetWidth() {\n        return width;\n    }\n    \n    public double GetHeight() {\n        return height;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains methods that are not relevant to all shapes. The `IRectangle` interface contains methods for calculating the area of a rectangle, but not other shapes like circles or triangles.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class Shape {\n    private string type;\n    \n    public Shape(string type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n    \n    public string GetType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface IAreaCalculator {\n    double CalculateArea(Shape shape);\n}\n\npublic class AreaCalculator : IAreaCalculator {\n    public double CalculateArea(Shape shape) {\n        if (shape.GetType() == \"rectangle\") {\n            Rectangle rectangle = (Rectangle) shape;\n            return rectangle.GetWidth() * rectangle.GetHeight();\n        } else if (shape.GetType() == \"circle\") {\n            Circle circle = (Circle) shape;\n            return Math.PI * circle.GetRadius() * circle.GetRadius();\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard-coded dependency on the `Shape` class, which is not an abstract class and cannot be easily swapped out for a different implementation.

The `Character` class implements an interface that provides methods for calculating damage, but it does not provide any functionality related to damage calculation.

By making the `Character` class an abstract class, we can decouple the `DamageCalculator` class from the `Character` class and make it more flexible and maintainable.\n\nIn summary, the `Character` class violates several principles of object-oriented design, including the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open-Closed Principle, the Liskov Substitution Principle, the Interface Segregation Principle, and the Dependency Inversion Principle.

The `Animal` class is responsible for both representing an animal and making sounds, which are two separate responsibilities.\n\n**OCP**\n```csharp\npublic interface ISoundMaker {\n    string MakeSound(string type);\n}\n\nclass DogSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(string type) {\n        return \"Woof!\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass CatSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(string type) {\n        return \"Meow!\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `MakeSound` method in the `Animal` class is hardcoded to handle only two types of animals, which means that if a new type of animal is added, the class will need to be modified.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IAnimal {\n    string GetType();\n}\n\nclass Dog : IAnimal {\n    public string GetType() {\n        return \"dog\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat : IAnimal {\n    public string GetType() {\n        return \"cat\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not possible to substitute a `Dog` object for a `Cat` object without breaking the program. The `GetType` method in the `Animal` class returns a string that represents the type of animal, but this string is not used anywhere in the code.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface ISoundMaker {\n    string MakeSound(string type);\n}\n\nclass DogSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(string type) {\n        return \"Woof!\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass CatSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(string type) {\n        return \"Meow!\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains multiple methods that are not relevant to each other. The `ISoundMaker` interface is responsible for making sounds, but it also includes methods that are not related to sound making, such as `GetType`.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class Animal {\n    private string type;\n\n    public Animal(string type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n\n    public string GetType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog : Animal {\n    public Dog() : base(\"dog\") {\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat : Animal {\n    public Cat() : base(\"cat\") {\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface ISoundMaker {\n    string MakeSound(Animal animal);\n}\n\nclass DogSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(Animal animal) {\n        return \"Woof!\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass CatSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(Animal animal) {\n        return \"Meow!\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hardcoded dependency on the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. The `ISoundMaker` interface should not have any knowledge of specific types of animals, but rather should be able to work with any type of animal that implements the `IAnimal` interface.\n\n**Refactoring:**\n```csharp\npublic class Animal {\n    private string type;\n\n    public Animal(string type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n\n    public string GetType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog : Animal {\n    public Dog() : base(\"dog\") {\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat : Animal {\n    public Cat() : base(\"cat\") {\n    }\n}\n\npublic interface IAnimal {\n    string GetType();\n}\n\npublic interface ISoundMaker {\n    string MakeSound(IAnimal animal);\n}\n\nclass DogSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(IAnimal animal) {\n        return \"Woof!\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass CatSoundMaker : ISoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(IAnimal animal) {\n        return \"Meow!\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThis refactoring fixes the violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle by removing the hardcoded dependency on the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. The `ISoundMaker` interface now depends only on the `IAnimal` interface, which allows it to work with any type of animal that implements the `IAnimal` interface.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Animal {\n    private string type;\n\n    public Animal(string type) {\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n\n    public string GetType() {\n        return type;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Dog : Animal {\n    public Dog() : base(\"dog\") {\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat : Animal {\n    public Cat() : base(\"cat\") {\n    }\n}\n\nclass SoundMaker {\n    public string MakeSound(Animal animal) {\n        if (animal.GetType() == \"dog\") {\n            return \"Woof!\";\n        } else if (animal.GetType() == \"cat\") {\n            return \"Meow!\";\n        }\n        return \"...\";\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.911007165908813}

These two responsibilities should be separated into different classes.\n\n**OCP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IVehicle\n{\n    double CalculateMaxSpeed();\n}\n\npublic class Car : IVehicle\n{\n    private int horsePower;\n\n    public Car(int horsePower)\n    {\n        this.horsePower = horsePower;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateMaxSpeed()\n    {\n        return horsePower * 0.4;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Bicycle : IVehicle\n{\n    private int gearCount;\n\n    public Bicycle(int gearCount)\n    {\n        this.gearCount = gearCount;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateMaxSpeed()\n    {\n        return gearCount * 5.0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `CalculateMaxSpeed` method in the `SpeedCalculator` class is hardcoded to handle only two types of vehicles, which means that if a new type of vehicle is added, the class will need to be modified. To fix this violation, we can create an interface `IVehicle` with a `CalculateMaxSpeed` method and have both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes implement it. This way, if a new type of vehicle is added, we can simply add a new class that implements the `IVehicle` interface without modifying the existing code.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic class Car : Vehicle\n{\n    private int horsePower;\n\n    public Car(int horsePower) : base(\"car\")\n    {\n        this.horsePower = horsePower;\n    }\n\n    public int GetHorsePower()\n    {\n        return horsePower;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable. The `Car` class inherits from the `Vehicle` class, but it does not follow the LSP. For example, if we have a method that takes a `Vehicle` object as an argument and expects to be able to call the `GetType` method on it, this method will not work with a `Car` object because it does not inherit from `Vehicle`. To fix this violation, we can add a new method to the `Vehicle` class that returns the type of vehicle, and then have both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes implement it. This way, we can ensure that any code that expects to be able to call the `GetType` method on a `Vehicle` object will also work with a `Car` or `Bicycle` object.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic class SpeedCalculator\n{\n    public double CalculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle)\n    {\n        if (vehicle.GetType() == \"car\")\n        {\n            Car car = (Car)vehicle;\n            return car.GetHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        }\n        else if (vehicle.GetType() == \"bicycle\")\n        {\n            Bicycle bicycle = (Bicycle)vehicle;\n            return bicycle.GetGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it is not segregated. The `SpeedCalculator` class has a dependency on both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes, which means that if we want to add a new type of vehicle, we will need to modify the `SpeedCalculator` class. To fix this violation, we can create separate interfaces for each type of vehicle, such as `ICar` and `IBicycle`, and have both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes implement them. This way, if we want to add a new type of vehicle, we can simply create a new interface that inherits from the `IVehicle` interface and have the new class implement it.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class SpeedCalculator\n{\n    public double CalculateMaxSpeed(Vehicle vehicle)\n    {\n        if (vehicle.GetType() == \"car\")\n        {\n            Car car = (Car)vehicle;\n            return car.GetHorsePower() * 0.4;\n        }\n        else if (vehicle.GetType() == \"bicycle\")\n        {\n            Bicycle bicycle = (Bicycle)vehicle;\n            return bicycle.GetGearCount() * 5.0;\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it is not inverted. The `SpeedCalculator` class has a hardcoded dependency on both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes, which means that if we want to change the implementation of how maximum speed is calculated, we will need to modify the `SpeedCalculator` class. To fix this violation, we can invert the dependency by creating an interface for the calculation method, such as `ISpeedCalculator`, and have both `Car` and `Bicycle` classes implement it. This way, if we want to change the implementation of how maximum speed is calculated, we can simply create a new class that implements the `ISpeedCalculator` interface without modifying the existing code.\n\nOverall, this code violates several principles of object-oriented programming, including the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open-Closed Principle, the Liskov Substitution Principle, the Interface Segregation Principle, and the Dependency Inversion Principle. To fix these violations, we can create separate classes for each type of vehicle, implement interfaces for each type of vehicle, and invert the dependency between the `SpeedCalculator` class and the vehicle classes.

This makes the class difficult to test and maintain.\n\n**OCP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentProcessor {\n    void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount);\n}\n\npublic class CreditCardPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Validating credit card information\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Charging credit card\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the credit card transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PayPalPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Redirecting user to PayPal\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Confirming PayPal payment\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the PayPal transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BankTransferPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing bank transfer of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generating bank transfer instructions\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sending transfer confirmation email\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the bank transfer transaction\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `ProcessPayment` method in the `PaymentProcessor` class is hardcoded to handle credit card, PayPal, and bank transfer payments. If a new payment type (e.g., Apple Pay) were to be added, the class would need to be modified, which violates the closed-for-modification principle.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentProcessor {\n    void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount);\n}\n\npublic class CreditCardPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Validating credit card information\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Charging credit card\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the credit card transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PayPalPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Redirecting user to PayPal\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Confirming PayPal payment\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the PayPal transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BankTransferPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing bank transfer of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generating bank transfer instructions\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sending transfer confirmation email\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the bank transfer transaction\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not substitutable. The `ProcessPayment` method in the `CreditCardPaymentProcessor`, `PayPalPaymentProcessor`, and `BankTransferPaymentProcessor` classes are all different, which makes them difficult to substitute for each other.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentProcessor {\n    void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount);\n}\n\npublic class CreditCardPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Validating credit card information\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Charging credit card\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the credit card transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PayPalPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Redirecting user to PayPal\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Confirming PayPal payment\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the PayPal transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BankTransferPaymentProcessor : IPaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing bank transfer of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generating bank transfer instructions\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sending transfer confirmation email\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the bank transfer transaction\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it is not segregated. The `IPaymentProcessor` interface has a single method that handles all payment types, which makes it difficult to separate concerns and create smaller, more focused interfaces.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IPaymentGateway {\n    void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount);\n}\n\npublic class CreditCardPaymentGateway : IPaymentGateway {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Validating credit card information\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Charging credit card\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the credit card transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class PayPalPaymentGateway : IPaymentGateway {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Redirecting user to PayPal\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Confirming PayPal payment\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the PayPal transaction\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class BankTransferPaymentGateway : IPaymentGateway {\n    public void ProcessPayment(string paymentType, double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing bank transfer of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generating bank transfer instructions\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sending transfer confirmation email\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the bank transfer transaction\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it is not inverted. The `CreditCardPaymentGateway`, `PayPalPaymentGateway`, and `BankTransferPaymentGateway` classes are tightly coupled to the `IPaymentProcessor` interface, which makes them difficult to test and maintain.\n\n**SRP**\n```csharp\npublic class PaymentProcessor {\n    public void ProcessCreditCardPayment(double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing credit card payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Validating credit card information\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Charging credit card\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the credit card transaction\");\n    }\n\n    public void ProcessPayPalPayment(double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing PayPal payment of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Redirecting user to PayPal\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Confirming PayPal payment\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the PayPal transaction\");\n    }\n\n    public void ProcessBankTransferPayment(double amount) {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Processing bank transfer of ${amount}\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Generating bank transfer instructions\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sending transfer confirmation email\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Recording the bank transfer transaction\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Single Responsibility Principle because it has multiple responsibilities. The `PaymentProcessor` class is responsible for processing credit card payments, PayPal payments, and bank transfer payments.

For example, we can create a `ReportFormatter` class that is responsible for formatting the report data and returning it as a byte array, and another class called `FileWriter` that is responsible for writing the file to disk. This will allow us to keep the `ReportExporter` class focused on its primary responsibility of exporting reports.\n\n**OCP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IDataSource {\n    Report GetReport(string reportId);\n    ReportData GetReportData(string reportId);\n}\n```\nThis interface violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. If we need to add a new data source, such as an API or a database, we will have to modify the existing code to accommodate this change. Instead, we can use dependency injection to allow the `ReportExporter` class to be extended with new data sources without modifying its existing code.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IFileSystem {\n    bool WriteFile(string path, byte[] data);\n}\n```\nThis interface violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not a subtype of `IFileSystem`. The `WriteFile` method in this interface does not have the same signature as the `WriteFile` method in the original `IFileSystem` interface, which means that we cannot use this interface to replace the original `IFileSystem` interface.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic class ReportExporter {\n    private IDataSource dataSource;\n    private IFileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporter(IDataSource dataSource, IFileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a large interface with many methods that are not relevant to its primary responsibility of exporting reports. By breaking up the `IDataSource` and `IFileSystem` interfaces into smaller, more focused interfaces, we can reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to maintain.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class ReportExporter {\n    private IDataSource dataSource;\n    private IFileSystem fileSystem;\n    \n    public ReportExporter(IDataSource dataSource, IFileSystem fileSystem) {\n        this.dataSource = dataSource;\n        this.fileSystem = fileSystem;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `IDataSource` and `IFileSystem` interfaces, which means that we cannot easily swap out these dependencies with different implementations. Instead, we can use dependency injection to allow the `ReportExporter` class to be extended with new data sources or file systems without modifying its existing code.\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\npublic interface IDataSource {\n    Report GetReport(string reportId);\n    ReportData GetReportData(string reportId);\n}\n```\nThe `IDataSource` interface violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `Report` and `ReportData` classes, which means that we cannot easily swap out these dependencies with different implementations. Instead, we can use dependency injection to allow the `ReportExporter` class to be extended with new data sources or file systems without modifying its existing code.\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```csharp\npublic interface IFileSystem {\n    bool WriteFile(string path, byte[] data);\n}\n```\nThe `IFileSystem` interface violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `WriteFile` method, which means that we cannot easily swap out this method with a different implementation.

It is not open for extension because new report types (e.g., \"weekly\", \"monthly\") cannot be added without modifying the existing code. It is also closed for modification because any changes to the existing report types (e.g., adding a new field to the `Sale` class) will require modifications to the existing code.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic class Sale {\n    private string productName;\n    private double amount;\n    private DateTime date;\n    private string region;\n    \n    public Sale(string productName, double amount, DateTime date, string region) {\n        this.productName = productName;\n        this.amount = amount;\n        this.date = date;\n        this.region = region;\n    }\n    \n    // ...\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not follow the principle of substitutability. The `Sale` class is not a generalization of the `Product` class, and any changes to the `Sale` class will require modifications to the existing code that uses the `Product` class.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public string GenerateReport(string reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a large interface with many methods that are not relevant to its clients. The `ReportGenerator` class is responsible for generating reports of different types (daily, product, regional), which makes it difficult to understand and maintain.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class SalesData {\n    private List<Sale> sales;\n    \n    public SalesData(List<Sale> sales) {\n        this.sales = sales;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Sale> GetSales() {\n        return sales;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `List` class, which makes it difficult to test and maintain. The `SalesData` class should have a soft dependency on the `List` class, which means that it should not be responsible for creating or managing instances of the `List` class. Instead, it should rely on an abstraction (e.g., an interface) that can be implemented by different classes.\n\n**Refactoring:**\nTo fix the violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can introduce an abstraction (e.g., an interface) for the `List` class and make the `SalesData` class dependent on this abstraction instead of the `List` class directly. Here is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```csharp\npublic interface IList<T> {\n    void Add(T item);\n    T Get(int index);\n}\n\npublic class SalesData {\n    private IList<Sale> sales;\n    \n    public SalesData(IList<Sale> sales) {\n        this.sales = sales;\n    }\n    \n    public List<Sale> GetSales() {\n        return sales;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have introduced an interface `IList<T>` that defines the methods required to interact with a list of items (e.g., adding and getting items). The `SalesData` class is now dependent on this abstraction instead of the `List` class directly, which makes it easier to test and maintain.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class ReportGenerator {\n    public string GenerateReport(string reportType, SalesData data) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 7.056525945663452}

The `TaxCalculator` class is tightly coupled to the `Order` class, which means that if a new requirement comes up that requires the tax calculator to handle a different type of order, such as a discounted order, the class will need to be modified. This makes it difficult to extend the code without breaking existing functionality.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic class OrderItem {\n    private string productId;\n    private double price;\n    private int quantity;\n    private string category;\n    \n    public OrderItem(string productId, double price, int quantity, string category) {\n        this.productId = productId;\n        this.price = price;\n        this.quantity = quantity;\n        this.category = category;\n    }\n    \n    public string GetProductId() {\n        return productId;\n    }\n    \n    public double GetPrice() {\n        return price;\n    }\n    \n    public int GetQuantity() {\n        return quantity;\n    }\n    \n    public string GetCategory() {\n        return category;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it is not a proper subclass of the `Order` class. The `OrderItem` class does not have all the properties and methods that are required by the `Order` class, which makes it difficult to use in place of an `Order`.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface IOrder {\n    string GetCustomerId();\n    List<IOrderItem> GetItems();\n}\n\npublic interface IOrderItem {\n    string GetProductId();\n    double GetPrice();\n    int GetQuantity();\n    string GetCategory();\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains all the properties and methods of both `Order` and `OrderItem`. This makes it difficult to use only a subset of the functionality provided by the interface, which can lead to unnecessary complexity in the code.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class TaxCalculator {\n    private readonly ITaxProvider _taxProvider;\n    \n    public TaxCalculator(ITaxProvider taxProvider) {\n        _taxProvider = taxProvider;\n    }\n    \n    public double CalculateTax(Order order) {\n        return _taxProvider.GetTaxRate(order);\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `ITaxProvider` interface, which means that if the implementation of the `ITaxProvider` interface changes, the `TaxCalculator` class will need to be modified. This makes it difficult to change the tax provider without breaking existing functionality.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Order {\n    private string customerId;\n    private List<OrderItem> items;\n    private string country;\n    \n    public Order(string customerId, List<OrderItem> items, string country) {\n        this.customerId = customerId;\n        this.items = items;\n        this.country = country;\n    }\n    \n    public string GetCustomerId() {\n        return customerId;\n    }\n    \n    public List<OrderItem> GetItems() {\n        return items;\n    }\n    \n    public string GetCountry() {\n        return country;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 6.618957996368408}
