This way, any new animal can be added without modifying the base class:\n```java\npublic interface Soundable {\n    String getSound();\n}\n\npublic class Animal implements Soundable {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The animal makes a sound\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Dog extends Animal {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The dog barks\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cat extends Animal {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The cat meows\";\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, any new animal can be added without modifying the base class:\n```java\npublic class Fish implements Soundable {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The fish makes a splashing sound\";\n    }\n}\n```\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    private int width;\n    private int height;\n\n    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    public void setWidth(int width) {\n        this.width = width;\n    }\n\n    public void setHeight(int height) {\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    public int getArea() {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `Rectangle` class has a method that returns the area of the rectangle, but it also allows setting the width and height separately. This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) because if we have a reference to a `Rectangle`, we can set its width or height independently, which goes against the principle of not changing the state of an object through inheritance.\n\nTo fix this, we can make the `width` and `height` fields private and provide getters and setters for them:\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    private int width;\n    private int height;\n\n    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    public void setWidth(int width) {\n        this.width = width;\n    }\n\n    public void setHeight(int height) {\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    public int getArea() {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the `Rectangle` class is immutable and its state cannot be changed through inheritance.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic interface Animal {\n    void eat();\n    void sleep();\n    void play();\n}\n```\nThe `Animal` interface has three methods: `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `play()`. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) because it forces implementing classes to implement methods that are not relevant to them. For example, a fish does not need to implement the `play()` method, so it would be unnecessary for the interface to require it.\n\nTo fix this, we can split the interface into smaller interfaces that each represent a specific behavior:\n```java\npublic interface Eatable {\n    void eat();\n}\n\npublic interface Sleepable {\n    void sleep();\n}\n\npublic interface Playable {\n    void play();\n}\n\npublic class Animal implements Eatable, Sleepable, Playable {\n    @Override\n    public void eat() {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sleep() {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void play() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the `Animal` class only implements the interfaces that are relevant to it.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class HighLevelClass {\n    private LowLevelClass lowLevelClass;\n\n    public HighLevelClass(LowLevelClass lowLevelClass) {\n        this.lowLevelClass = lowLevelClass;\n    }\n\n    public void doSomething() {\n        lowLevelClass.doSomething();\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `HighLevelClass` class directly depends on the `LowLevelClass`, which violates the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). This means that if we want to change the implementation of the `LowLevelClass`, we would need to modify the `HighLevelClass`.\n\nTo fix this, we can introduce an abstraction layer between the two classes:\n```java\npublic interface LowLevelInterface {\n    void doSomething();\n}\n\npublic class LowLevelClass implements LowLevelInterface {\n    @Override\n    public void doSomething() {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\npublic class HighLevelClass {\n    private LowLevelInterface lowLevelInterface;\n\n    public HighLevelClass(LowLevelInterface lowLevelInterface) {\n        this.lowLevelInterface = lowLevelInterface;\n    }\n\n    public void doSomething() {\n        lowLevelInterface.doSomething();\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, the `HighLevelClass` depends on an abstraction layer that can be swapped out for a different implementation of the `LowLevelInterface`.", "violation": "OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**OCP**", "solution_code": "public class Animal {\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The animal makes a sound\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Dog extends Animal {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The dog barks\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cat extends Animal {\n    @Override\n    public String getSound() {\n        return \"The cat meows\";\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 9.481783151626587}

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```kotlin\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O. Now it only generates the report, following SRP.\n\nHere is the code:\nopen class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) {\n    open fun setWidth(w: Int) { width = w }\n    open fun setHeight(h: Int) { height = h }\n}\n\nclass Square(size: Int) : Rectangle(size, size) {\n    override fun setWidth(w: Int) {\n        width = w\n        height = w\n    }\n    override fun setHeight(h: Int) {\n        width = h\n        height = h\n    }\n}\n\nfun resizeRectangle(rect: Rectangle) {\n    rect.setWidth(5)\n    rect.setHeight(10)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val square = Square(5)\n    resizeRectangle(square)\n}", "raw_response": "**OCP**\n```kotlin\nopen class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) {\n    open fun setWidth(w: Int) { width = w }\n    open fun setHeight(h: Int) { height = h }\n}\n\nclass Square(size: Int) : Rectangle(size, size) {\n    override fun setWidth(w: Int) {\n        width = w\n        height = w\n    }\n    override fun setHeight(h: Int) {\n        width = h\n        height = h\n    }\n}\n\nfun resizeRectangle(rect: Rectangle) {\n    rect.setWidth(5)\n    rect.setHeight(10)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val square = Square(5)\n    resizeRectangle(square)\n}\n```\nThe `resizeRectangle` function violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) because it modifies the state of an object directly, which is a violation of the open-closed principle. Instead, we should use polymorphism to allow the rectangle to be resized in a way that is independent of its implementation.\n\nHere's a refactored version of the code that follows the OCP:\n```kotlin\nopen class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) {\n    open fun setWidth(w: Int) { width = w }\n    open fun setHeight(h: Int) { height = h }\n}\n\nclass Square(size: Int) : Rectangle(size, size) {\n    override fun setWidth(w: Int) {\n        width = w\n        height = w\n    }\n    override fun setHeight(h: Int) {\n        width = h\n        height = h\n    }\n}\n\ninterface Resizable {\n    fun resize(width: Int, height: Int)\n}\n\nfun resizeRectangle(rect: Resizable) {\n    rect.resize(5, 10)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val square = Square(5)\n    resizeRectangle(square)\n}\n```\nIn this version of the code, we've defined an interface `Resizable` that has a single method `resize`, which takes two parameters for the new width and height. We've also modified the `resizeRectangle` function to take an object of type `Resizable` as its parameter, rather than a concrete class like `Square`. This allows us to pass any object that implements the `Resizable` interface to the `resizeRectangle` function, without having to know its specific implementation details.\n\nThe `Square` class is still responsible for setting its own width and height, but it does so by calling the `resize` method on itself, which allows us to resize the square in a way that is independent of its implementation.", "violation": "OCP", "violation_list": ["OCP"], "explanation": "**OCP**", "solution_code": "open class Rectangle(var width: Int, var height: Int) {\n    open fun setWidth(w: Int) { width = w }\n    open fun setHeight(h: Int) { height = h }\n}\n\nclass Square(size: Int) : Rectangle(size, size) {\n    override fun setWidth(w: Int) {\n        width = w\n        height = w\n    }\n    override fun setHeight(h: Int) {\n        width = h\n        height = h\n    }\n}\n\nfun resizeRectangle(rect: Rectangle) {\n    rect.setWidth(5)\n    rect.setHeight(10)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val square = Square(5)\n    resizeRectangle(square)\n}", "duration_seconds": 4.5237133502960205}

This way, `SilentNotification` can implement both interfaces without violating ISP.\n\nHere's the refactored code:\n```kotlin\ninterface Notifier {\n    fun send(message: String) {}\n}\n\ninterface SMSNotifier : Notifier {\n    fun sendSMS(message: String) {}\n}\n\nclass EmailNotifier : Notifier {\n    override fun send(message: String) {\n        println(\"Email: $message\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass SilentNotification : EmailNotifier(), SMSNotifier {\n    override fun sendSMS(message: String) {\n        throw UnsupportedOperationException()\n    }\n}\n\nfun notifyUser(notifier: Notifier, message: String) {\n    notifier.send(message)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val emailNotifier = EmailNotifier()\n    val smsNotifier = SilentNotification()\n    notifyUser(emailNotifier, \"Hello\")\n    notifyUser(smsNotifier, \"Hello\")\n}\n```", "violation": "ISP", "violation_list": ["ISP"], "explanation": "**ISP**", "solution_code": "interface Notifier {\n    fun send(message: String) {}\n}\n\nclass EmailNotifier : Notifier {\n    override fun send(message: String) {\n        println(\"Email: $message\")\n    }\n}\n\nclass SMSNotifier : Notifier {\n    override fun send(message: String) {\n        println(\"SMS: $message\")\n    }\n}\n\nfun notifyUser(notifier: Notifier, message: String) {\n    notifier.send(message)\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val emailNotifier = EmailNotifier()\n    val smsNotifier = SMSNotifier()\n    notifyUser(emailNotifier, \"Hello\")\n    notifyUser(smsNotifier, \"Hello\")\n}", "duration_seconds": 3.5166282653808594}

This violates the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) because it forces any new subclasses of `Shape` to also override the `Draw()` method, even if they don't need to.\n\nTo fix this, we can introduce an interface that defines the `Draw()` method and make `Shape` implement that interface:\n```c#\npublic interface IDrawable\n{\n    void Draw();\n}\n\npublic class Shape : IDrawable\n{\n    public virtual void Draw()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Drawing a shape\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Circle : Shape\n{\n    public override void Draw()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Drawing a circle\");\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, any new subclasses of `Shape` can simply implement the `IDrawable` interface and provide their own implementation of the `Draw()` method without having to override the base class's method.

However, the `Cat` class throws an exception instead of making a sound. This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) because it breaks the contract of the base class.\n\nTo fix this, we can remove the `throw new NotImplementedException()` and provide a default implementation for the method:\n```c#\npublic abstract class Animal\n{\n    public abstract void MakeSound();\n}\n\npublic class Dog : Animal\n{\n    public override void MakeSound()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Woof!\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cat : Animal\n{\n    public override void MakeSound()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Meow!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, any new subclasses of `Animal` can simply provide their own implementation of the `MakeSound()` method without having to worry about breaking the contract of the base class.

This violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) because it forces any new classes that implement the `ILogger` interface to also implement the `IFileWriter` interface, even if they don't need to.\n\nTo fix this, we can introduce a separate interface for file writing:\n```c#\npublic interface IFileWriter\n{\n    void WriteToFile(string filePath, string content);\n}\n\npublic class Logger : ILogger\n{\n    public void Log(string message)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"[{DateTime.Now:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] {message}\");\n    }\n}\n```\nNow, any new classes that implement the `ILogger` interface can simply provide their own implementation of the `Log()` method without having to worry about implementing the `IFileWriter` interface.
