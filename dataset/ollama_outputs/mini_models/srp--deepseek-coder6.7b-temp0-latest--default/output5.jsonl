Executing tasks and sending failure notifications can be done by separate classes for each type of task (e.g., `ReportEmailExecutor`, `DataSyncExecutor`). \n\nHere is a simplified example:\n\n```kotlin\nclass TaskFetcher(private val dbUrl: String) {\n    fun fetchPendingTasks(): List<ScheduledTask> {\n        // Fetching pending tasks from DB logic here...\n    }\n}\n\nclass UpdateStatusUpdater(private val dbUrl: String) {\n    fun updateTaskStatus(task: ScheduledTask) {\n        // Updating status in DB logic here...\n    }\n}\n\ninterface TaskExecutor {\n    fun execute(task: ScheduledTask): Boolean\n}\n\nclass ReportEmailExecutor : TaskExecutor {\n    override fun execute(task: ScheduledTask): Boolean {\n        // Execute task logic for REPORT_EMAIL type here...\n    }\n}\n\nclass DataSyncExecutor : TaskExecutor {\n    override fun execute(task: ScheduledTask): Boolean {\n        // Execute task logic for DATA_SYNC type here...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen in the `JobExecutor` class, you can use these classes like this:\n\n```kotlin\nclass JobExecutor(private val dbUrl: String, private val smtpHost: String) {\n    private val taskFetcher = TaskFetcher(dbUrl)\n    private val updateStatusUpdater = UpdateStatusUpdater(dbUrl)\n    private val reportEmailExecutor = ReportEmailExecutor()\n    private val dataSyncExecutor = DataSyncExecutor()\n    \n    fun run() {\n        val tasks = taskFetcher.fetchPendingTasks()\n        \n        for (task in tasks) {\n            updateStatusUpdater.updateTaskStatus(task)\n            \n            when (task.type) {\n                \"REPORT_EMAIL\" -> reportEmailExecutor.execute(task)\n                \"DATA_SYNC\" -> dataSyncExecutor.execute(task)\n                else -> println(\"Unknown task type: ${task.type}\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis way, each class has a single responsibility and the `JobExecutor` class is only responsible for coordinating these responsibilities. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle.", "violation": "SRP", "violation_list": ["SRP"], "explanation": "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is violated in this code because the `JobExecutor` class has more than one responsibility. It fetches tasks, updates task statuses, executes tasks and sends failure notifications. \n\nTo refactor it to comply with SRP, we can separate these responsibilities into different classes:\n\n1. Fetching pending tasks from the database should be handled by a `TaskFetcher` class.\n2. Updating task statuses in the database should be handled by an `UpdateStatusUpdater` class.\n3.

Separation of Concerns - The class `BusinessReportProcessor` has multiple responsibilities such as fetching data from database, transforming data, generating report file, and uploading the report. It's not following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). \n2. Open-Closed Principle - This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In this case, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we would have to modify the `FetchSalesData` and `TransformDataForReport` methods which violates OCP.\n3.

Here, `BusinessReportProcessor` class does not have a direct dependency on an interface which is compliant with ISP. \n\nRefactoring suggestions:\n- Create separate classes for each responsibility like DataFetcher, DataTransformer, ReportGenerator and Uploader.

This way, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we only have to modify that specific class without affecting others.\n- For OCP violation, you can create an interface `IDataFetcher` and `IDataTransformer` with methods for fetching and transforming the data respectively. The classes `BusinessReportProcessor` and these new classes will depend on this interface instead of concrete implementations. This way, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we only have to modify that specific class without affecting others.\n- For ISP violation, you can create separate interfaces for each functionality like `IDataFetcher`, `IDataTransformer`, `IReportGenerator` and `IUploader`.

However, it can be refactored for better readability and maintainability. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Separation of Concerns - The class `BusinessReportProcessor` has multiple responsibilities such as fetching data from database, transforming data, generating report file, and uploading the report. It's not following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). \n2. Open-Closed Principle - This principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In this case, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we would have to modify the `FetchSalesData` and `TransformDataForReport` methods which violates OCP.\n3. Liskov Substitution Principle - This principle states that subclasses must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program. In this case, there doesn't seem to be any violation as per the given code.\n4. Interface Segregation Principle - This principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Here, `BusinessReportProcessor` class does not have a direct dependency on an interface which is compliant with ISP. \n\nRefactoring suggestions:\n- Create separate classes for each responsibility like DataFetcher, DataTransformer, ReportGenerator and Uploader. These new classes will adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as they have a single responsibility. This way, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we only have to modify that specific class without affecting others.\n- For OCP violation, you can create an interface `IDataFetcher` and `IDataTransformer` with methods for fetching and transforming the data respectively. The classes `BusinessReportProcessor` and these new classes will depend on this interface instead of concrete implementations. This way, if we need to change how data is fetched or transformed, we only have to modify that specific class without affecting others.\n- For ISP violation, you can create separate interfaces for each functionality like `IDataFetcher`, `IDataTransformer`, `IReportGenerator` and `IUploader`.
