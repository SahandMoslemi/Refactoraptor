By introducing an interface `IAccount`, we separate the concerns and ensure that each class implements only what it needs. This makes the system more maintainable and scalable.\n\n2. **SRP**: The `Account` class is responsible for managing its balance, which aligns with the SRP principle. However, the `LimitedWithdrawalAccount` class could be further refactored to separate concerns if needed.\n\n3. **OCP**: The code is open for extension but closed for modification, as new types of accounts can be added without modifying existing code.\n\n4. **LSP**: The code adheres to LSP because subclasses (`LimitedWithdrawalAccount`) correctly override the `Withdraw` method and maintain the contract defined by the base class (`Account`).\n\n5. **DIP**: The code does not explicitly demonstrate DIP, but it can be improved by injecting dependencies (e.g., using a service locator or constructor injection) to decouple the classes further.\n\nThe most impactful violation is ISP, as it significantly improves the design of the system by separating concerns and making the code more maintainable.", "violation": "ISP, SRP, OCP, LSP, DIP", "violation_list": ["ISP", "SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "DIP"], "explanation": "[SOLID ratings above]\n\n**ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)**", "solution_code": "", "duration_seconds": 5.2019641399383545}

This allows for easy extension without modifying existing classes. The `ModifyingCollectionProcessor` now implements `IProcessor` but does not modify the input list directly, instead performing its operations on a copy or using a different approach to achieve the same result.\n\n2. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**:\n   - Both original and refactored code adhere to SRP as each class has a single responsibility.\n\n3. **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)**:\n   - The refactored code maintains LSP because any object of type `IProcessor` can be substituted for an instance of `CollectionProcessor` or `ModifyingCollectionProcessor` without altering the correctness of the program.\n\n4. **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)**:\n   - The refactored code adheres to ISP as it introduces a specific interface `IProcessor` that clearly defines the contract for processing collections, avoiding unnecessary methods or properties.\n\n5. **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**:\n   - The refactored code does not explicitly demonstrate DIP because there are no external dependencies being inverted. However, by using an interface, it sets a foundation for future inversion of control if needed.", "violation": "OCP, SRP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["OCP", "SRP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "[SOLID ratings above]\n\n**OCP**", "solution_code": "", "duration_seconds": 5.176506757736206}
