The God Object principle is violated because the class has multiple responsibilities and is responsible for playing music, controlling the playback, and managing the CD/Vinyl player.\n\n**SRP: 2 (bad)**\n\nThe SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In this case, the MusicPlayer class has multiple responsibilities, including playing music, controlling the playback, and managing the CD/Vinyl player. This makes it more difficult to maintain and modify the code in the future.\n\n**OCP: 4 (good)**\n\nThe OCP states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. In this case, we have extended the MusicPlayer interface to include new functionality by creating separate classes for CD and Vinyl players. This allows us to add new types of music players without modifying the existing code.\n\n**LSP: 5 (good)**\n\nThe LSP states that a subclass should be substitutable for its superclass. In this case, we have created separate subclasses for CD and Vinyl players that implement the MusicPlayer interface. This allows us to use the CDPlayer or VinylPlayer class interchangeably with the MusicPlayer class without affecting the behavior of the code.\n\n**ISP: 4 (good)**\n\nThe ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. In this case, we have created separate interfaces for CD and Vinyl players that only include the methods needed by each type of player. This allows us to reduce coupling between classes and make the code more modular and maintainable.\n\n**DIP: 5 (good)**\n\nThe DIP states that a client should not depend on concrete classes but rather on abstractions. In this case, we have created separate interfaces for CD and Vinyl players that define the methods needed to play music. This allows us to decouple the code from specific implementations of the MusicPlayer interface and make it more flexible and maintainable in the future.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**God Object**", "solution_code": "public class MusicPlayer implements MusicPlayer {\n    public void play() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n    public void pause() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n    public void stop() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n    public void skipTrack() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n    public void eject() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 6.522740840911865}

It is responsible for managing the state of a vehicle, but it also provides functionality for starting, stopping, driving, flying, and diving. This makes the class difficult to understand and maintain, as any changes to the vehicle's behavior will require changes to multiple methods in the class.\n\n**OCP**\n```java\npublic interface Vehicle {\n    void start();\n    void stop();\n}\n\npublic class Car implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Plane implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Plane engine started.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Plane engine stopped.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Submarine implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Submarine powered up.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Submarine powered down.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `Vehicle` interface defines the behavior of a vehicle, but it does not provide any mechanism for adding new vehicles or modifying existing ones. This means that if a new type of vehicle is introduced (e.g., a hovercraft), it would require changes to the codebase to accommodate it.\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class Vehicle {\n    private String type;\n    private int wheels;\n    private boolean canFly;\n    private boolean canDive;\n\n    public Vehicle(String type, int wheels, boolean canFly, boolean canDive) {\n        this.type = type;\n        this.wheels = wheels;\n        this.canFly = canFly;\n        this.canDive = canDive;\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive() {\n        if (wheels > 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is driving on the road.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot drive without wheels.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void fly() {\n        if (canFly) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is flying.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot fly.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void dive() {\n        if (canDive) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is diving underwater.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot dive without the ability to fly.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not follow the principle of substitutability. The `Vehicle` class is a base class that defines the behavior of a vehicle, but it also has state (e.g., `type`, `wheels`, `canFly`, and `canDive`) that is specific to each type of vehicle. This means that if a new type of vehicle is introduced (e.g., a hovercraft), it would require changes to the codebase to accommodate it, even though it could be substituted for a `Vehicle` object in many cases.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic interface Vehicle {\n    void start();\n    void stop();\n}\n\npublic class Car implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Plane implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Plane engine started.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Plane engine stopped.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Submarine implements Vehicle {\n    @Override\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Submarine powered up.\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Submarine powered down.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that defines the behavior of multiple types of vehicles, even though some of those behaviors (e.g., `start()` and `stop()`) are not relevant to all types of vehicles. This means that if a new type of vehicle is introduced (e.g., a hovercraft), it would require changes to the codebase to accommodate it, even though it could be substituted for a `Vehicle` object in many cases.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class Vehicle {\n    private String type;\n    private int wheels;\n    private boolean canFly;\n    private boolean canDive;\n\n    public Vehicle(String type, int wheels, boolean canFly, boolean canDive) {\n        this.type = type;\n        this.wheels = wheels;\n        this.canFly = canFly;\n        this.canDive = canDive;\n    }\n\n    public void start() {\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        System.out.println(\"Vehicle stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive() {\n        if (wheels > 0) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is driving on the road.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot drive without wheels.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void fly() {\n        if (canFly) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is flying.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot fly.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void dive() {\n        if (canDive) {\n            System.out.println(\"Vehicle is diving underwater.\");\n        } else {\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Vehicle cannot dive without the ability to fly.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `String` and `int` types, which are not objects that can be easily swapped out or mocked.

If a new type of character is added, such as a `Warrior`, the interface would need to be modified to include the new methods. This could lead to a fragile design where changes to the interface require modifications to multiple classes.\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class GameContext {\n    private Character character;\n\n    public GameContext(Character character) {\n        this.character = character;\n    }\n\n    public void setCharacter(Character newCharacter) {\n        this.character = newCharacter;\n    }\n\n    public void move() {\n        character.walk();\n        character.fly();\n    }\n\n    public void attack() {\n        character.meleeAttack();\n        character.castSpell();\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        character.displayRole();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not follow the principle of substitutability. If a `Warrior` class is added that extends the `Character` interface, it would need to implement all of the methods defined in the interface, even if some of them are not applicable to the `Warrior` class. This could lead to a design where certain classes are not able to be used interchangeably with others, which goes against the principle of substitutability.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic interface Character {\n    void walk();\n    void fly();\n    void meleeAttack();\n    void castSpell();\n    void displayRole();\n}\n```\nThis interface violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it contains methods that are not relevant to all implementations of the interface. For example, the `Ranger` class does not need to implement the `castSpell()` method, as it cannot cast spells. This could lead to a design where certain classes are forced to implement methods that they do not need or use, which goes against the principle of segregation.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class GameContext {\n    private Character character;\n\n    public GameContext(Character character) {\n        this.character = character;\n    }\n\n    public void move() {\n        character.walk();\n        character.fly();\n    }\n\n    public void attack() {\n        character.meleeAttack();\n        character.castSpell();\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        character.displayRole();\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `Character` interface, which could lead to a fragile design where changes to the interface require modifications to multiple classes. It would be better to have a higher-level abstraction that depends on an interface rather than a concrete implementation.\n\nOverall, this design is not ideal because it violates several principles of object-oriented programming, such as the Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. It would be better to have a more modular and flexible design that follows these principles.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class GameContext {\n    private Character character;\n\n    public GameContext(Character character) {\n        this.character = character;\n    }\n\n    public void setCharacter(Character newCharacter) {\n        this.character = newCharacter;\n    }\n\n    public void move() {\n        character.walk();\n        character.fly();\n    }\n\n    public void attack() {\n        character.meleeAttack();\n        character.castSpell();\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        character.displayRole();\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 9.895176410675049}

This will allow us to decouple the Shape class from the Math library and make it more flexible and maintainable.\n\nHere is an example of how the code could be refactored:\n```java\npublic interface MathLibrary {\n    double PI = 3.14;\n    \n    double calculateArea(double radius);\n    double calculatePerimeter(double radius);\n}\n\npublic class Circle implements Shape {\n    private double radius;\n    \n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculateArea() {\n        return MathLibrary.calculateArea(radius);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculatePerimeter() {\n        return MathLibrary.calculatePerimeter(radius);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculateVolume() {\n        System.out.println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\");\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have introduced an abstraction layer between the Shape class and the Math library. The MathLibrary interface defines the methods that are required to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, which are then implemented in the MathLibrary class. This allows us to decouple the Shape class from the Math library and make it more flexible and maintainable.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Shape {\n    private double radius;\n    \n    public Circle(double radius) {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculateArea() {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculatePerimeter() {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public double calculateVolume() {\n        System.out.println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\");\n        return 0.0;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 9.614470958709717}

These methods should be moved to a separate class that specializes in these tasks.\n\n**OCP**\n```java\npublic interface NotificationSender {\n    void sendEmail(String recipient, String subject, String body);\n    void sendSMS(String phoneNumber, String message);\n    void sendPushNotification(String deviceId, String title, String message);\n    void sendSlackMessage(String channel, String message);\n}\n```\nThis interface violates the Open-Closed Principle because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. If a new notification method needs to be added, such as sending a WhatsApp message, the interface will need to be modified, which breaks the principle of being open for extension.\n\n**LSP**\n```java\npublic class EmailService implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendEmail(String recipient, String subject, String body) {\n        System.out.println(\"Sending email to \" + recipient + \" with subject: \" + subject);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendSMS(String phoneNumber, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support SMS\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendPushNotification(String deviceId, String title, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support push notifications\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendSlackMessage(String channel, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support Slack messages\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it breaks the contract of the `NotificationSender` interface. The method `sendSMS` throws an exception, which is not a valid behavior for a notification sender. Similarly, the methods `sendPushNotification` and `sendSlackMessage` also throw exceptions, which are not valid behaviors for a notification sender.\n\n**ISP**\n```java\npublic interface NotificationReceiver {\n    void receiveEmail(String sender, String subject, String body);\n    void receiveSMS(String sender, String message);\n    void receivePushNotification(String appId, String title, String message);\n    void receiveSlackMessage(String channel, String message);\n}\n```\nThis interface violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it contains methods that are not relevant to the receiver. The `receiveEmail` method is not relevant to a notification receiver, as it only handles emails and does not handle other types of notifications. Similarly, the `receiveSMS`, `receivePushNotification`, and `receiveSlackMessage` methods are also not relevant to a notification receiver.\n\n**DIP**\n```java\npublic class EmailClient implements NotificationReceiver {\n    @Override\n    public void receiveEmail(String sender, String subject, String body) {\n        System.out.println(\"Received email from \" + sender + \" with subject: \" + subject);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void receiveSMS(String sender, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailClient does not handle SMS\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void receivePushNotification(String appId, String title, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailClient does not handle push notifications\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void receiveSlackMessage(String sender, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailClient does not handle Slack messages\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `NotificationSender` interface. The class is dependent on the implementation of the `NotificationSender` interface, which makes it difficult to test and maintain. A better approach would be to have the class depend on an abstraction, such as an interface or an abstract class, that defines the behavior of a notification sender, rather than depending on a specific implementation.\n\nOverall, these violations suggest that the design of the system is not well-structured and may need to be refactored to improve its maintainability and scalability.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class EmailService implements NotificationSender {\n    @Override\n    public void sendEmail(String recipient, String subject, String body) {\n        System.out.println(\"Sending email to \" + recipient + \" with subject: \" + subject);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendSMS(String phoneNumber, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support SMS\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendPushNotification(String deviceId, String title, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support push notifications\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void sendSlackMessage(String channel, String message) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"EmailService does not support Slack messages\");\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 8.348036527633667}

The `Resume` and `PortalUser` classes are tightly coupled to each other, which makes it difficult to change one without affecting the other.

This class is dependent on the specific implementation of the disc, such as CDPlayer or VinylPlayer, which goes against the principle of having low coupling and high cohesion.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nThe Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. In this case, the MusicPlayer class has multiple responsibilities, such as playing, pausing, stopping, skipping tracks, and ejecting the disc. These are all different functionalities that should be handled by separate classes.\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create separate classes for each type of disc, such as CDPlayer and VinylPlayer, to handle their respective responsibilities. This will allow us to add new types of discs without modifying the existing code.\n\nHere is an example of how the refactored code might look:\n```python\nclass MusicPlayer:\n    def play(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def pause(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def stop(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def skip_track(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def eject(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\nclass CDPlayer:\n    def play(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def pause(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def stop(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def skip_track(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def eject(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\nclass VinylPlayer:\n    def play(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def pause(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def stop(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def skip_track(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def eject(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n```", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class MusicPlayer:\n    def play(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def pause(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def stop(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def skip_track(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass\n\n    def eject(self):\n        # Example code\n        pass", "duration_seconds": 8.349758625030518}

If we have a method that expects an instance of `LightBulb`, and we pass in an instance of `RegularLightBulb`, the method will not work as expected.

In this case, the `TV` class has methods for setting the volume and locking the device, which are not necessary for controlling a TV. These methods should be moved to a separate interface or subclass.\n\n**DIP**\n```python\nclass SmartLock(DeviceControl):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.is_locked = False\n\n    def turn_on(self):\n        print(\"SmartLock doesn't need to be turned on.\")\n\n    def turn_off(self):\n        print(\"SmartLock doesn't need to be turned off.\")\n\n    def volume_up(self):\n        print(\"Volume control not supported on SmartLock.\")\n\n    def volume_down(self):\n        print(\"Volume control not supported on SmartLock.\")\n\n    def lock(self):\n        self.is_locked = True\n        print(\"SmartLock is now locked.\")\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `DeviceControl` interface, which is not flexible or maintainable.

This class should be split into separate classes for each responsibility, such as `Walker`, `Flyer`, `MeleeAttacker`, `SpellCaster`, and `RoleDisplayer`.\n\nRefactored code:\n```python\nclass Walker:\n    def walk(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Flyer:\n    def fly(self):\n        pass\n\nclass MeleeAttacker:\n    def melee_attack(self):\n        pass\n\nclass SpellCaster:\n    def cast_spell(self):\n        pass\n\nclass RoleDisplayer:\n    def display_role(self):\n        pass\n```\nExplanation of the refactoring:\nThe `Character` class has been split into separate classes for each responsibility, allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability. Each class has a single responsibility and is easier to understand and modify. The `GameContext` class has also been refactored to use these new classes, making it more flexible and easier to extend.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class Character:\n    def walk(self):\n        pass\n\n    def fly(self):\n        pass\n\n    def melee_attack(self):\n        pass\n\n    def cast_spell(self):\n        pass\n\n    def display_role(self):\n        pass", "duration_seconds": 7.60991096496582}

If we want to add a new type of shape, such as a sphere, we would need to modify the existing code to handle this new case. Instead, we should use an abstract class or interface that defines the common behavior of shapes and let subclasses implement the specific behavior for each shape.\n\n**LSP**\n```python\nclass Shape:\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n    def calculate_area(self):\n        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2\n\n    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius\n\n    def calculate_volume(self):\n        print(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not satisfy the LSP. The `calculate_area` method returns a value that is not a square of the radius, which violates the principle of returning the same type of object as the parent class. Similarly, the `calculate_perimeter` method returns a value that is not twice the circumference of the circle, which also violates the LSP.\n\n**ISP**\n```python\nclass Shape:\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n    def calculate_area(self):\n        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2\n\n    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius\n\n    def calculate_volume(self):\n        print(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that includes methods that are not relevant to all shapes, such as `calculate_volume` which is only applicable to 3D shapes. Instead, we should have separate interfaces for each type of shape, such as `AreaCalculator`, `PerimeterCalculator`, and `VolumeCalculator`.\n\n**DIP**\n```python\nclass Shape:\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\n    def calculate_area(self):\n        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2\n\n    def calculate_perimeter(self):\n        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius\n\n    def calculate_volume(self):\n        print(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `math` module, which is an external dependency that can change over time. Instead, we should have a separate interface for each type of shape and let the client code decide which shape to use based on its specific requirements.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create separate classes for each type of shape, such as `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Line`, and `Cube`. Each class will have its own implementation of the `calculate_area`, `calculate_perimeter`, and `calculate_volume` methods.

It is not necessary to have a single interface for all notification formats. Instead, each format should have its own interface that only includes the methods required by that format. This makes it easier to maintain and extend the code.\n\n**DIP**\n```python\nclass NotificationSender:\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send_notification(self, recipient, subject, body): pass\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a high level of coupling with its dependencies. It is not necessary for the notification sender to know the specific implementation details of the notification receiver. Instead, the notification sender should only depend on the interfaces provided by the notification receiver. This makes it easier to change the code without breaking existing functionality.\n\n**Single most violated principle: OCP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create separate classes for each notification format (e.g., EmailService, SMSService, PushNotificationService, SlackService) and implement the send_notification method in each class. This will allow us to add new notification formats without modifying existing code.\n```python\nclass EmailService:\n    def send_email(self, recipient, subject, body):\n        print(f\"Sending email to {recipient} with subject: {subject}\")\n\nclass SMSService:\n    def send_sms(self, phone_number, message):\n        print(f\"Sending SMS to {phone_number}: {message}\")\n\nclass PushNotificationService:\n    def send_push_notification(self, device_id, title, message):\n        print(f\"Sending push notification to {device_id} with title: {title} and message: {message}\")\n\nclass SlackService:\n    def send_slack_message(self, channel, message):\n        print(f\"Sending Slack message to {channel}: {message}\")\n```\nThis will allow us to add new notification formats without modifying existing code.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class NotificationSender:\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send_email(self, recipient, subject, body): pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send_sms(self, phone_number, message): pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send_push_notification(self, device_id, title, message): pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def send_slack_message(self, channel, message): pass", "duration_seconds": 6.204060077667236}

The class is tightly coupled to the discs and the playback device, which makes it difficult to change or replace any of these components without affecting the entire system. This goes against the principle of having low coupling between modules and high cohesion within them.\n\n**Refactored Code:**\n```kotlin\npublic interface Disc {\n    fun play()\n    fun pause()\n    fun stop()\n    fun skipTrack()\n    fun eject()\n}\n\npublic class CDPlayer : Disc {\n    override fun play() {\n        println(\"CD is playing.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun pause() {\n        println(\"CD is paused.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun stop() {\n        println(\"CD stopped.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun skipTrack() {\n        println(\"Skipping to next CD track.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun eject() {\n        println(\"CD ejected.\")\n    }\n}\n\npublic class VinylPlayer : Disc {\n    override fun play() {\n        println(\"Vinyl record is playing.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun pause() {\n        println(\"Vinyl playback paused (lift the needle).\")\n    }\n\n    override fun stop() {\n        println(\"Vinyl playback stopped.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun skipTrack() {\n        println(\"Can't skip track on a vinyl record!\")\n    }\n\n    override fun eject() {\n        println(\"Can't eject a vinyl record like a CD!\")\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this refactored code, we have separated the responsibilities of playing different types of discs into separate classes that implement the same interface. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle and Interface Segregation Principle. We also have used dependency injection to decouple the playback device from the discs, which follows the Dependency Inversion Principle.\n\nExplanation:\nThe refactored code has a more modular structure, with each class responsible for a specific task (playing a CD or vinyl record). This makes it easier to add new types of discs or playback devices without affecting the entire system. The interface segregation principle is also followed by having separate interfaces for each type of disc and playback device, which allows for more focused and smaller interfaces that are easier to maintain and extend. Finally, the dependency inversion principle is followed by using dependency injection to decouple the playback device from the discs, which makes it easier to change or replace any of these components without affecting the entire system.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class MusicPlayer {\n    public void play() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n\n    public void pause() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n\n    public void skipTrack() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n\n    public void eject() {\n        // Example code\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 9.281978130340576}

If a `Wizard` is a subclass of `Character`, then it should be able to be used in place of any other type of character without breaking the code that uses it.

Similarly, the `Rectangle` class is responsible for both calculating its area and perimeter, but it also calculates its volume which doesn't make sense for a 2D shape.\n\n**OCP**\n```kotlin\ninterface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n    fun calculateVolume(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        return side * side * side\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) because it is not open for extension and closed for modification. The `Shape` interface has a fixed set of methods that are used by all shape classes, which means that if we want to add a new method to the interface, we would have to modify all the existing shape classes.\n\n**LSP**\n```kotlin\ninterface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n    fun calculateVolume(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        return side * side * side\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) because it is not substitutable. The `Line` class has a different behavior than the other shape classes, which means that it cannot be used as a substitute for the other shape classes in all situations. For example, if we have a method that takes a `Shape` object as an argument and expects it to calculate its volume, it would not work correctly with a `Line` object because it does not have a volume.\n\n**ISP**\n```kotlin\ninterface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n    fun calculateVolume(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        return side * side * side\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) because it has a large and complex interface that contains methods that are not relevant to all shape classes. For example, the `Line` class does not need to have the `calculateVolume()` method, as it is not a 3D shape. Similarly, the `Circle` class does not need to have the `calculatePerimeter()` method, as it is already defined by its area.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\ninterface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n    fun calculateVolume(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        return side * side * side\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) because it has a tight coupling between the `Shape` interface and its implementations. The `Shape` interface is dependent on the specific implementation of each shape, which makes it difficult to change or replace any of the shapes without affecting the entire system.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can introduce an abstraction layer that separates the `Shape` interface from its implementations. This will allow us to decouple the `Shape` interface from its specific implementation and make it easier to change or replace any of the shapes without affecting the entire system.\n\nHere is an example of how we can implement this:\n```kotlin\ninterface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have introduced an abstraction layer that separates the `Shape` interface from its implementations. The `Shape` interface is now dependent only on the abstract methods that are common to all shapes, and it does not know anything about the specific implementation of each shape. This makes it easier to change or replace any of the shapes without affecting the entire system.\n\nWe can also use this approach to decouple the `Shape` interface from its dependencies, such as the `Math` class in our previous example. By introducing an abstraction layer that separates the `Shape` interface from its dependencies, we can make it easier to change or replace any of the dependencies without affecting the entire system.\n\nIn summary, by using the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), we can decouple the dependencies of our code and make it more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. This allows us to write code that is easier to change, replace, or extend over time, and makes it easier to develop and maintain large software systems.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "interface Shape {\n    fun calculateArea(): Double\n    fun calculatePerimeter(): Double\n    fun calculateVolume(): Double\n}\n\nclass Circle(private val radius: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(private val width: Double, private val height: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return width * height\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 2 * (width + height)\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 2D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Line(private val length: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating area for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return length\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        println(\"Warning: Calculating volume for a 1D shape doesn't make sense!\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cube(private val side: Double) : Shape {\n    override fun calculateArea(): Double {\n        return 6 * side * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculatePerimeter(): Double {\n        return 12 * side\n    }\n\n    override fun calculateVolume(): Double {\n        return side * side * side\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 22.63883066177368}

The `Router` class is a subclass of the `NetworkDevice` interface, but it does not follow the LSP. For example, the `Router` class has its own implementation of the `connect()` method, which may not be compatible with other implementations of the `NetworkDevice` interface.\n\n**ISP**\n```kotlin\nclass DeviceManager {\n    fun configureDevice(device: Any) {\n        when (device) {\n            is NetworkDevice -> {\n                device.displayInfo()\n                device.connect()\n            }\n            is MultimediaDevice -> {\n                device.displayInfo()\n                device.powerOn()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains methods that are not relevant to all devices. The `configureDevice()` method in this class is responsible for configuring any device, regardless of its type. However, some devices may not need certain configuration options, such as the `setScreenResolution()` method, which is only relevant to multimedia devices.\n\n**DIP**\n```kotlin\nclass DeviceManager {\n    fun updateFirmware(device: NetworkDevice) {\n        println(\"Updating firmware for ${device.getDeviceName()}\")\n        device.updateFirmware(\"v2.4.1\")\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `NetworkDevice` interface, which may not be suitable for all devices. The `updateFirmware()` method in this class is only relevant to network devices, but it requires an instance of the `NetworkDevice` interface as its parameter. This means that other types of devices will not be able to use this method without implementing the `NetworkDevice` interface, which may not be desirable.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class Router(private val name: String, private val ipAddress: String) : NetworkDevice {\n    override fun connect() {\n        println(\"Router $name established connection.\")\n    }\n\n    override fun transferData(data: String) {\n        println(\"Router transferring data: $data\")\n    }\n\n    override fun runDiagnostics() {\n        println(\"Running diagnostics on router $name\")\n    }\n\n    override fun updateFirmware(version: String) {\n        println(\"Router firmware updated to version: $version\")\n    }\n\n    override fun getDeviceName(): String = name\n\n    override fun displayInfo() {\n        println(\"Router: $name, IP: $ipAddress\")\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 7.134493350982666}

Interfaces are used to define a contract or a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements them. In this case, the `NotificationService` interface has two methods: `sendBookingConfirmation()` and `sendCancellationNotice()`.\n2. `enum class FlightStatus`: This defines an enum called `FlightStatus`. Enums are used to define a set of named constants that can be used in your code. In this case, the `FlightStatus` enum has six possible values: `SCHEDULED`, `BOARDING`, `DEPARTED`, `LANDED`, `CANCELLED`, and `DELAYED`.\n3. `enum class PaymentMethod`: This defines an enum called `PaymentMethod`. Enums are used to define a set of named constants that can be used in your code. In this case, the `PaymentMethod` enum has three possible values: `CREDIT_CARD`, `DEBIT_CARD`, and `PAYPAL`.\n4. `data class Flight`: This defines a data class called `Flight`. Data classes are used to define a class that contains only immutable data (i.e., data that cannot be changed after it is created). In this case, the `Flight` data class has six properties: `flightNumber`, `origin`, `destination`, `departureTime`, `arrivalTime`, and `status`.\n5. `data class Booking`: This defines a data class called `Booking`. Data classes are used to define a class that contains only immutable data (i.e., data that cannot be changed after it is created). In this case, the `Booking` data class has four properties: `bookingId`, `passengerId`, `flightNumber`, and `bookingTime`.\n6. `class EmailService : NotificationService`: This defines a class called `EmailService` that implements the `NotificationService` interface. In this case, the `EmailService` class has two methods: `sendBookingConfirmation()` and `sendCancellationNotice()`. These methods are used to send booking confirmations and cancellation notices via email.\n7. `class ReportingService : NotificationService`: This defines a class called `ReportingService` that implements the `NotificationService` interface. In this case, the `ReportingService` class has two methods: `generateBookingReport()` and `getBookingStatistics()`. These methods are used to generate booking reports and retrieve booking statistics.\n8. `fun main(args: Array<String>)`: This is the entry point of the program. It defines a function called `main` that takes an array of strings as its argument. The `main` function is where you would typically put your code that runs when the program starts. In this case, the `main` function simply prints a message to the console.\n\nOverall, this program demonstrates how to use interfaces and enums in Kotlin, as well as how to define data classes and implement interfaces.", "violation": "Unknown", "violation_list": [], "explanation": "The code you provided is a Kotlin program that demonstrates the use of interfaces and enums in Kotlin.

The `MultiFunctionDevice` interface defines three methods that are specific to each device, which means that any new device that needs to be added will require changes to the interface. This makes it difficult to add new devices without breaking existing code.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic class BasicPrinter : MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    public void print(string document)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + document);\n    }\n\n    public void scan()\n    {\n        // Can't actually scan\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot scan documents!\");\n    }\n\n    public void fax(string recipient)\n    {\n        // Can't actually fax\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot send faxes!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not follow the principle of substitutability. The `BasicPrinter` class is not a generalization of the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface, as it only implements a subset of the methods defined in the interface. This means that any code that uses the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface will not be able to use the `BasicPrinter` class without modification.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    void print(string document);\n    void scan();\n    void fax(string recipient);\n}\n\npublic class BasicPrinter : MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    public void print(string document)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + document);\n    }\n\n    public void scan()\n    {\n        // Can't actually scan\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot scan documents!\");\n    }\n\n    public void fax(string recipient)\n    {\n        // Can't actually fax\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot send faxes!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it has a single interface that contains methods that are not relevant to all devices. The `MultiFunctionDevice` interface defines three methods, but only two of them (print and scan) are relevant to the `BasicPrinter` class. This means that any new device that needs to be added will require changes to the interface, which violates the principle of separation of concerns.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic interface MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    void print(string document);\n    void scan();\n    void fax(string recipient);\n}\n\npublic class BasicPrinter : MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    public void print(string document)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + document);\n    }\n\n    public void scan()\n    {\n        // Can't actually scan\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot scan documents!\");\n    }\n\n    public void fax(string recipient)\n    {\n        // Can't actually fax\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot send faxes!\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface, which means that any changes to the interface will require changes to the dependent classes (in this case, the `BasicPrinter` class). This makes it difficult to change the interface without breaking existing code.\n\n**Refactoring:**\nTo fix the violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle, we can introduce an abstraction layer between the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface and the dependent classes (in this case, the `BasicPrinter` class). This will allow us to change the implementation of the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface without affecting the dependent classes.\n```csharp\npublic interface IPrinter\n{\n    void Print(string document);\n}\n\npublic class BasicPrinter : IPrinter\n{\n    public void Print(string document)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + document);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, we have introduced an `IPrinter` interface that defines a single method (`Print`) that is relevant to all devices. This interface can be used as a dependency for any class that needs to interact with a printer device. The `BasicPrinter` class implements the `IPrinter` interface and provides the implementation of the `Print` method.\n\nThis refactoring allows us to change the implementation of the `MultiFunctionDevice` interface without affecting the dependent classes (in this case, the `BasicPrinter` class). It also makes it easier to add new devices that need to be added in the future, as we can simply create a new class that implements the `IPrinter` interface and use it as a dependency for any code that needs to interact with a printer device.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class BasicPrinter : MultiFunctionDevice\n{\n    public void print(string document)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Printing: \" + document);\n    }\n\n    public void scan()\n    {\n        // Can't actually scan\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot scan documents!\");\n    }\n\n    public void fax(string recipient)\n    {\n        // Can't actually fax\n        Console.WriteLine(\"ERROR: This printer cannot send faxes!\");\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 11.502300024032593}

The `searchJobs` method in this class does not follow the contract specified by the `PortalUser` interface, which requires that the method return a list of jobs. This violation makes it difficult to use the `JobSeeker` class as a substitute for the `PortalUser` interface in other parts of the system.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic class Recruiter : PortalUser\n{\n    public void searchJobs()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Recruiters don't search for jobs.\");\n    }\n\n    public void applyForJob(Resume resume)\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Recruiters don't apply for jobs.\");\n    }\n\n    public void postJob(string jobDescription)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Job posted: \" + jobDescription);\n    }\n\n    public void reviewApplicants()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Reviewing applicants...\");\n    }\n\n    public void manageSiteSettings()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Recruiters can't manage site settings.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it implements methods that are not relevant to its role as a recruiter. The `searchJobs` and `applyForJob` methods are not necessary for a recruiter, so they should be removed from the interface. This will make the interface more focused and easier to understand.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class Administrator : PortalUser\n{\n    public void searchJobs()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Admins don't search for jobs.\");\n    }\n\n    public void applyForJob(Resume resume)\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Admins don't apply for jobs.\");\n    }\n\n    public void postJob(string jobDescription)\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Admins don't post jobs.\");\n    }\n\n    public void reviewApplicants()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Admins don't review applicants.\");\n    }\n\n    public void manageSiteSettings()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Managing site settings...\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it has a hard dependency on the `Console` class, which is an external dependency that cannot be easily changed or mocked. This makes it difficult to test the class and make changes to the system without affecting its behavior.\n\n**Single most violated principle: LSP**\n\nTo fix this violation, we can create a new interface called `JobSearcher` that has a single method for searching for jobs, and then have the `Recruiter` and `Administrator` classes implement this interface. This will make it easier to use these classes as substitutes for each other in other parts of the system, while still maintaining the contract specified by the `PortalUser` interface.\n\nHere is an example of how this could be implemented:\n```\npublic interface JobSearcher\n{\n    List<Job> SearchForJobs();\n}\n\npublic class Recruiter : PortalUser, JobSearcher\n{\n    public List<Job> SearchForJobs()\n    {\n        // Implementation for searching for jobs\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Administrator : PortalUser, JobSearcher\n{\n    public List<Job> SearchForJobs()\n    {\n        // Implementation for searching for jobs\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will make it easier to use the `Recruiter` and `Administrator` classes as substitutes for each other in other parts of the system, while still maintaining the contract specified by the `PortalUser` interface.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Resume\n{\n    public string content;\n\n    public Resume(string content)\n    {\n        this.content = content;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 9.237674713134766}

The `Vehicle` interface defines all the possible actions that a vehicle can perform, but it does not provide any mechanism for extending the set of actions to include new vehicles or new types of vehicles.\n\n**LSP**\n```csharp\npublic class Car : Vehicle\n{\n    public void start()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car is driving on the road.\");\n    }\n\n    public void fly()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot fly.\");\n    }\n\n    public void dive()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot dive.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it does not satisfy the \"is-a\" relationship with its parent class. A `Car` is not a `Vehicle`, and it should not be able to perform actions that are not supported by all vehicles, such as flying or diving.\n\n**ISP**\n```csharp\npublic interface Vehicle\n{\n    void start();\n    void stop();\n    void drive();\n    void fly();\n    void dive();\n}\n\npublic class Car : Vehicle\n{\n    public void start()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car is driving on the road.\");\n    }\n\n    public void fly()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot fly.\");\n    }\n\n    public void dive()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot dive.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it provides a single interface that contains all the possible actions that a vehicle can perform, even though some of those actions are not relevant to all vehicles. For example, a `Car` cannot fly or dive, so it should not be able to perform those actions.\n\n**DIP**\n```csharp\npublic class Car : Vehicle\n{\n    public void start()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car is driving on the road.\");\n    }\n\n    public void fly()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot fly.\");\n    }\n\n    public void dive()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot dive.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code violates the Dependency Inversion Principle because it does not provide any mechanism for injecting dependencies into the `Vehicle` class. The `Vehicle` class is tightly coupled to the concrete implementation of the `start`, `stop`, `drive`, `fly`, and `dive` methods, which makes it difficult to test or modify the code.\n\nTo fix these violations, we could introduce a new interface for each type of vehicle that defines the specific actions that are relevant to that type of vehicle. For example:\n```\npublic interface Car {\n    void start();\n    void stop();\n    void drive();\n}\n\npublic class CarImpl implements Car {\n    public void start() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car is driving on the road.\");\n    }\n}\n```\nThis would allow us to define a `Vehicle` interface that only includes the actions that are relevant to all vehicles, and then define separate interfaces for each type of vehicle that defines the specific actions that are relevant to that type of vehicle. This would help to reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to test and modify.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "public class Car : Vehicle\n{\n    public void start()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car started.\");\n    }\n\n    public void stop()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car stopped.\");\n    }\n\n    public void drive()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Car is driving on the road.\");\n    }\n\n    public void fly()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot fly.\");\n    }\n\n    public void dive()\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Car cannot dive.\");\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 11.241397619247437}

These interfaces can be implemented by the `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Cube` classes, while the `Line` class can only implement the `IPerimeterCalculator` interface.\n\nHere is the refactored code:", "solution_code": "public interface IAreaCalculator\n{\n    double CalculateArea();\n}\n\npublic interface IPerimeterCalculator\n{\n    double CalculatePerimeter();\n}\n\npublic interface IVolumeCalculator\n{\n    double CalculateVolume();\n}\n\npublic class Circle : IAreaCalculator, IPerimeterCalculator, IVolumeCalculator\n{\n    private double radius;\n\n    public Circle(double radius)\n    {\n        this.radius = radius;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateArea()\n    {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculatePerimeter()\n    {\n        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateVolume()\n    {\n        return Math.PI * radius * radius * radius;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Rectangle : IAreaCalculator, IPerimeterCalculator\n{\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n\n    public Rectangle(double width, double height)\n    {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateArea()\n    {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculatePerimeter()\n    {\n        return 2 * (width + height);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Line : IPerimeterCalculator\n{\n    private double length;\n\n    public Line(double length)\n    {\n        this.length = length;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculatePerimeter()\n    {\n        return length;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cube : IAreaCalculator, IPerimeterCalculator, IVolumeCalculator\n{\n    private double side;\n\n    public Cube(double side)\n    {\n        this.side = side;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateArea()\n    {\n        return 6 * side * side;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculatePerimeter()\n    {\n        return 12 * side;\n    }\n\n    public double CalculateVolume()\n    {\n        return side * side * side;\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 6.365578651428223}
