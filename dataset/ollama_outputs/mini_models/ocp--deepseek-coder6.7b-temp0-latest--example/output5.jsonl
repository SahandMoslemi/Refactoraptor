LSP: This principle is followed because every subclass of `Shape` behaves correctly, i.e., it doesn't break the contract of its base class (`Shape`).\n4. ISP: The interfaces are small and only contain methods that are necessary for each class.\n5.

specific requirements that need to be fulfilled by subclasses of `OrderItem` or `TaxCalculator`. \n\n**ISP**\n```python\nclass Order:\n    def __init__(self, customer_id, items, country):\n

no dependencies on concrete implementations following DIP.\n\n**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**\nIn the given code, each class has a single responsibility: \n- The Order class is responsible for handling order data.\n- The OrderItem class is responsible for handling item data related to an order.\nThe TaxCalculator class should also have its own responsibilities as it's currently handling all tax calculations which violates the SRP principle.\n\n**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**\nIn the given code, we can add new functionality without modifying existing code. For example, if we want to support a new type of item in our order, we could add a new OrderItem subclass for that type of item and it would work correctly as long as it provides all the methods required by the Order class.\n\n**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**\nIn this code, there are no specific requirements that need to be fulfilled by subclasses of `OrderItem` or `TaxCalculator`. Therefore, LSP is not violated in this code.\n\n**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**\nThe classes Order and OrderItem have single-responsibility methods following ISP as they provide only the specific functionality that clients can use.\n\n**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**\nIn the given code, we don't depend on concrete implementations but instead depend on abstractions. For example, we don't depend on a specific OrderItem or TaxCalculator class; we depend on interfaces that these classes implement.

This means that if we need to add more export formats, we can do so without changing its existing behavior. We achieve this by introducing a new interface (`DataSource`) and making the `generateReportData()` function generic.\n- **ISP**: The `ReportExporter` class has too many responsibilities. It is responsible for generating report data, writing to file system, and handling export formats. To follow ISP, we can split this into two separate classes or modules (like ReportGenerator and FileWriter).\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions. We achieve this by introducing interfaces for `DataSource` and `FileSystem` which are implemented in the high level class `ReportExporter`. This way, if we need to change how data is fetched or written (like from a database to file), we only have to modify the implementation of these interfaces without changing the `ReportExporter` class itself.", "violation": "OCP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["OCP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**OCP, ISP, DIP**", "solution_code": "interface DataSource {\n    fun getReport(reportId: String): Report?\n    fun getReportData(reportId: String): Any\n}\n\nclass PdfDocument  {\n    fun generate(): ByteArray  = TODO()\n}\n\nclass ExcelDocument  {\n    fun generate(): ByteArray = TODO()\n}\n\ninterface FileSystem {\n    fun writeFile(path: String, data: ByteArray) : Boolean\n}\n\nclass ReportExporter(private val dataSource: DataSource, private val fileSystem: FileSystem) {\n    \n    suspend fun exportReport(reportId: String, exportFormat: String, destination: String): ExportResult  {\n        val report = dataSource.getReport(reportId)\n        \n        if (report == null) \n            return ExportResult(false, \"Report not found\", null)\n        \n        val fileName = report.getTitle() + getFileExtension(exportFormat)\n        val reportData = generateReportData(dataSource.getReportData(reportId), exportFormat)\n        if (reportData == null) \n            return ExportResult(false, \"Failed to generate report\", null)\n        \n        fileSystem.writeFile(\"$destination/$fileName\", reportData)\n        return ExportResult(true, \"Report exported successfully\", \"$destination/$fileName\")\n    }\n    \n    private suspend fun generateReportData(report: Any, exportFormat: String): ByteArray? {\n        try  {\n            return when (exportFormat)  {\n                \"pdf\" -> {\n                    val document = PdfDocument()\n                    document.generate()\n                }\n                \"excel\" -> {\n                    val document = ExcelDocument()\n                    document.generate()\n                }\n                else -> null\n            }\n        } catch (e: Exception)  {\n            return null\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun getFileExtension(format: String): String  = when (format) {\n        \"pdf\" -> \".pdf\"\n        \"excel\" -> \".xlsx\"\n        else -> \".txt\"\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 5.445899724960327}

violation of SOLID principles. However, we can refactor it to follow these principles:\n- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility. The `Order` and `OrderItem` classes have this principle followed as they only hold data related to orders and order items respectively.\n- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): We can introduce new tax strategies without modifying the existing code, which follows OCP. For example, we could add a `CANatxStrategy` class that calculates taxes for Canada.\n- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): The `TaxCalculator` class uses an interface `TaxStrategy` instead of a concrete implementation, which allows us to easily switch between different tax strategies without modifying the `TaxCalculator` class itself.\n- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The `TaxStrategy` interface only includes methods that are necessary for any tax strategy, reducing the dependencies on specific implementations.\n- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): We depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete classes. This allows us to switch between different implementations without modifying the `TaxCalculator` class itself.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**NONE**", "solution_code": "class Order(\n    private val customerId: String,\n    private val items: List<OrderItem>,\n    private val country: String\n) {\n    fun getCustomerId(): String = customerId\n    \n    fun getItems(): List<OrderItem> = items\n    \n    fun getCountry(): String = country\n}\n\nclass OrderItem(\n    private val productId: String,\n    private val price: Double,\n    private val quantity: Int,\n    private val category: String\n) {\n    fun getProductId(): String = productId\n    \n    fun getPrice(): Double = price\n    \n    fun getQuantity(): Int = quantity\n    \n    fun getCategory(): String = category\n}\n\nclass TaxCalculator(private val taxStrategy: TaxStrategy) {\n    fun calculateTax(order: Order): Double  = taxStrategy.calculateTax(order)\n}\n\ninterface TaxStrategy {\n    fun calculateTax(order: Order): Double \n}\n\nclass USTaxStrategy : TaxStrategy {\n    override fun calculateTax(order: Order): Double {\n        val stateTaxRates = getStateTaxRates()\n        val categoryTaxRates = getCategoryTaxRates()\n        \n        val state = order.getCustomerId().substring(0, 2)\n        val stateTaxRate = stateTaxRates[state] ?: 0.05\n        \n        return order.getItems().sumOf { item ->\n            val itemPrice = item.getPrice() * item.getQuantity()\n            val categoryRate = categoryTaxRates[item.getCategory()] ?: 0.0\n            itemPrice * (stateTaxRate + categoryRate)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun getStateTaxRates(): Map<String, Double> {\n        //...\n    }\n    \n    private fun getCategoryTaxRates(): Map<String, Double> {\n        //...\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 5.425117254257202}

The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

It also has a class called ShippingService which contains the main logic for calculating shipping costs based on various factors such as weight, distance, method type (standard, express, overnight, international), etc.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with this code:\n\n1. The `Address` class is missing a constructor that takes all its fields as parameters. This means you can't create an instance of the `Address` class without knowing the values for each field. \n\n2. In the `CalculateDistance()` method, there are hardcoded distances for different cases (same city, same state, same country, international). It would be better to use a more sophisticated way to calculate distance between two locations if you need it in your application.\n\n3. The `ProcessOrder()` function is missing. This function should handle the process of calculating shipping cost and updating order status after an order has been shipped. \n\n4. There are no tests for this code. You might want to add some unit tests using a testing framework like JUnit or PyTest to ensure that your functions work as expected.\n\n5. The `ShippingCost` class is not used in the provided code, but it's mentioned in comments of other classes and methods. If you don't need this class, consider removing it from your codebase. \n\n6. In the `CalculateOrderWeight()` method, there seems to be a mistake where the weight of each product is multiplied by its quantity before being added to the total weight. It should probably be the other way around (product's weight * quantity).\n\n7. The shipping cost calculation methods in the ShippingService class are not handling all possible cases for different types of shipping methods and countries. \n\n8. There is no error checking or validation in place, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid data is passed into the system.
