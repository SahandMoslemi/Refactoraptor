To switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL, you need to change the JDBC URL in the main method and also update the database setup part if necessary (like changing table creation statements).\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the code:", "solution_code": "public static void main(String[] args) {\n    String testDbUrl = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/test_onboarding\"; // PostgreSQL JDBC URL\n    String testSmtpHost = \"localhost\";\n    \n    try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(testDbUrl, \"username\", \"password\")) { \n        // Assuming you have a user named 'username' with password 'password' to access the database\n        \n        // Drop and create tables if they exist\n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;\");\n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"CREATE TABLE users (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT UNIQUE, email TEXT UNIQUE, password_hash TEXT);\");\n        \n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_profiles;\");\n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"CREATE TABLE user_profiles (user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, registration_date DATE);\");\n        \n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS audit_log;\");\n        conn.createStatement().execute(\"CREATE TABLE audit_log (event_type TEXT, related_user TEXT, details TEXT);\");\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    \n    UserOnboardingService service = new UserOnboardingService(testDbUrl, testSmtpHost);\n\n    // Run some sample onboarding operations\n}", "duration_seconds": 4.4569196701049805}

Your task is to analyze the code provided and respond in the exact format below, without any additional text or commentary.\n\nYou must provide the following three parts in your response:\n1. The violated SOLID principle (e.g., SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP). If no violation exists, respond with **NONE**.\n2. A complete refactored version of the code that removes the violation. YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```java\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O.

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

The transformation process involves converting raw values to uppercase if they have more than 2 characters.\n\n4. `fetchSourceData()`: Fetches data from the source database. This method uses a JDBC PreparedStatement to execute an SQL query that selects all rows from the source table where processed is false.

The main components of this program are:\n\n1. `initializeDatabase()`: This method initializes the source and target databases by creating tables, inserting sample data into the source table, and deleting the target database file to start fresh.\n\n2. `DataMigrationService(String sourceDbUrl, String targetDbUrl)`: The constructor creates a new instance of DataMigrationService with the specified source and target database URLs. It also calls the initializeDatabase() method to set up the databases.\n\n3. `migrateData()`: This is the main method that performs data migration. It fetches data from the source database, transforms it, and then saves it into the target database. The transformation process involves converting raw values to uppercase if they have more than 2 characters.\n\n4. `fetchSourceData()`: Fetches data from the source database. This method uses a JDBC PreparedStatement to execute an SQL query that selects all rows from the source table where processed is false. It returns a list of SourceData objects representing these rows.\n\n5. `transformData(List<SourceData> sourceRecords)`: Transforms fetched data by converting raw values to uppercase if they have more than 2 characters. This method iterates over the provided list of SourceData objects, checks each one for a non-null and longer raw value, and adds a corresponding TargetData object with the same id and transformed (uppercased) value to the result list.\n\n6. `saveTargetData(List<TargetData> targetRecords)`: Saves transformed data into the target database. This method uses a JDBC PreparedStatement to execute an SQL insert query for each TargetData object in the provided list, effectively inserting them into the target table. It returns the number of records inserted.\n\n7. `logMigrationEvent(String eventType, String details, int count, boolean success)`: Logs a migration event with the specified parameters to the console. This method is used for debugging and tracking the progress of data migration.\n\n8. The static inner classes `SourceData` and `TargetData` represent source and target records respectively. They are simple Java objects that hold id and value attributes.\n\nThe main method in this program creates a new instance of DataMigrationService with URLs for an SQLite source database (source_migration.db) and another SQLite target database (target_migration.db), then calls the migrateData() method to perform data migration.", "solution_code": "", "duration_seconds": 4.415883302688599}

YOU MUST RETURN ONLY THE CODE BLOCK.\n3. A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*.

The child class (`TaskExecutor`) can be used in place of the parent class (`JobExecutor`). \n\nHowever, there are some methods that `TaskExecutor` has but `JobExecutor` does not have. For example, `sendFailureNotification()` and `updateTaskStatus()`. If these methods were to exist in both classes, we would violate LSP as the client code could no longer substitute one for the other without knowing about these additional methods.\n\n**ISP**\nThe `JobExecutor` class is not following the Interface Segregation Principle because it implements too many interfaces (`Runnable`, `Callable`). It would be better to split this into multiple smaller classes that each have a single responsibility. \n\nFor example:\n```kotlin\ninterface Task {\n    fun execute()\n}\n\nclass ReportEmailTask(private val payload: String) : Task {\n    override fun execute() {\n        // Implementation for sending report email task\n    }\n}\n\nclass DataSyncTask(private val payload: String) : Task {\n    override fun execute() {\n        // Implementation for data sync task\n    }\n}\n```\n**DIP**\nThe `JobExecutor` class is not following the Dependency Inversion Principle because it directly depends on concrete classes (`TaskExecutor`, `ScheduledTask`). \n\nFor example:\n```kotlin\ninterface Task {\n    fun execute()\n}\n\nclass ReportEmailTask(private val payload: String) : Task {\n    override fun execute() {\n        // Implementation for sending report email task\n    }\n}\n\nclass DataSyncTask(private val payload: String) : Task {<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>", "violation": "SRP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "class TaskExecutor {\n    fun executeTask(task: ScheduledTask): Boolean {\n        println(\"[JobExecutor] Executing task logic for type: ${task.type}\")\n        return when (task.type) {\n            \"REPORT_EMAIL\" -> sendReportEmailTask(task.payload)\n            \"DATA_SYNC\" -> performDataSyncTask(task.payload)\n            else -> {\n                println(\"[JobExecutor] Unknown task type: ${task.type}\")\n                false\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun sendReportEmailTask(payload: String): Boolean {\n        println(\"[JobExecutor] Running Send Report Email Task with payload: $payload\")\n        val parts = payload.split(\",\")\n        if (parts.size != 2) return false\n        val email = parts[0]\n        val reportName = parts[1]\n        println(\"[JobExecutor] Simulating sending $reportName report to $email...\")\n\n        return true\n    }\n    \n    private fun performDataSyncTask(payload: String): Boolean {\n        println(\"[JobExecutor] Running Data Sync Task with payload: $payload\")\n        val parts = payload.split(\",\")\n        if (parts.size != 2) return false\n        val source = parts[0]\n        val dest = parts[1]\n        println(\"[JobExecutor] Simulating syncing data from $source to $dest...\")\n\n        return true\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 5.793765306472778}

This way, the `ProductApiHandler` class is decoupled from concrete implementation of request validation and can now accept any object that implements `IRequestValidator` as a dependency. This adheres to Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).\n\n**ISP**\n```kotlin\ninterface IRequest { val method: String; val path: String; val headers: Map<String, String>; \n                     val body: String? }\nclass ApiRequest(override val method: String, override val path: String, \n                 override val headers: Map<String, String>, override val body: String?) : IRequest\n// ... other classes remain the same\n```\nIn this refactoring we have introduced an interface `IRequest` which is implemented by class `ApiRequest`. This way, if a new requirement comes in where we need to validate responses or any other requests apart from API requests, we can easily add more interfaces and classes without changing existing code. This adheres to Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).", "violation": "SRP, DIP, ISP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "DIP", "ISP"], "explanation": "**SRP**", "solution_code": "data class ApiRequest(val method: String, val path: String, val headers: Map<String, String>, val body: String?)\ndata class ApiResponse(val statusCode: Int, val headers: Map<String, String>, val body: String?)\n\nclass RequestValidator {\n    fun validateHeaders(headers: Map<String, String>): Boolean = headers.containsKey(\"Authorization\")\n    fun validateRequestBody(body: String?): Boolean = body != null && body.contains(\"name\") && body.contains(\"price\")\n}\n\nclass ProductApiHandler(private val validator: RequestValidator) {\n    // ... other methods remain the same\n}", "duration_seconds": 4.326862096786499}
