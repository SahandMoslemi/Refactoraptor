This has been refactored into three separate classes: `DataLoader`, `DataProcessor`, and `DataSaver`. Each class now has a single responsibility.\n2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: By separating concerns, it becomes easier to extend functionality without modifying existing code. For example, new data loading or saving mechanisms can be added by creating new classes that inherit from `DataLoader` or `DataSaver`.\n3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: The `ReadOnlyDataSaver` class now correctly overrides the `save_results` method to raise an exception without changing the expected behavior of the base class in a way that would break client code.\n4. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: By using separate classes for loading, processing, and saving data, the code is more decoupled and depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This makes it easier to swap out components without affecting other parts of the system.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "### SOLID RATINGS:\n- SRP: 2 - The `DataProcessor` class is responsible for loading, processing, and saving data, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle.\n- OCP: 3 - The `ReadOnlyDataProcessor` overrides the `save_results` method to raise an exception, but it doesn't extend functionality in a meaningful way.
