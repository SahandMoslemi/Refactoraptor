The class has methods for creating the table, updating order statuses, and sending emails.

You should add these at the beginning of your script:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nimport smtplib\nimport sqlite3\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n```\n\nSecondly, you've used `datetime.now().isoformat()` to get the current date and time in ISO format. However, this will not work as expected because it returns a string that represents the date and time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., '2022-03-04T15:30:00'). You should use `datetime.now()` to get the current date and time, which can be used directly in SQLite queries.\n\nThirdly, you've commented out the code for sending emails because it requires a working SMTP server. If you want to send emails, you need to uncomment this part of your code and provide valid values for `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, and `EMAIL_PASSWORD`.\n\nLastly, the example usage at the end of your script is incomplete because it doesn't include the necessary imports and global variable updates for the helper function to work correctly. You should add these before running the example usage:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport os\nDB_PATH = 'ecommerce.db'  # Update global for helper function\nupdater = OrderStatusUpdater(DB_PATH, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASSWORD)\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, your code should work as expected.", "violation": "Unknown", "violation_list": [], "explanation": "It seems like you're trying to create a class that updates the status of orders in an e-commerce database based on their payment status.
