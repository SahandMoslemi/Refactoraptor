The LSP states that if a program is using a base class, it should be able to use any of its subclasses without the program knowing or causing errors. In this case, when we call `resizeRectangle` with an instance of `Square`, which is a subclass of `Rectangle`, the function assumes that setting the width will also set the height (and vice versa), but in the case of a square, it's not true because changing one dimension doesn't affect the other.\n\nHere is how you can refactor the code to comply with LSP:\n\n```kotlin\nopen class Shape {\n    open var width: Int = 0\n    open var height: Int = 0\n}\n\nclass Rectangle(override var width: Int, override var height: Int) : Shape() \n\nclass Square(size: Int) : Shape() {\n    override var width: Int = size\n        set(value) {\n            field = value\n            height = value\n        }\n\n    override var height: Int = size\n        set(value) {\n            field = value\n            width = value\n        }\n}\n\nfun resizeRectangle(rect: Shape) {\n    rect.width = 5\n    rect.height = 10\n}\n\nfun main() {\n    val square = Square(5)\n    resizeRectangle(square)\n}\n```\nIn this refactored code, `Shape` is a base class for both `Rectangle` and `Square`.
