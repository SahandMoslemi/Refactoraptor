This can lead to unnecessary code complexity and maintenance overhead.\n3. **Inappropriate Intimacy**: The `AuthService` class may be tightly coupled with other classes, making it difficult to reuse or modify the code without affecting other parts of the system.\n4. **Lack of Separation of Concerns**: The `AuthService` class may handle multiple concerns related to authentication, logging out users, and sending login notifications. This can lead to a high degree of coupling between these concerns.\n5. **Poor Cohesion**: The methods in the `AuthService` class may not be closely related, leading to low cohesion within the class.\n6. **Unnecessary Dependencies**: The `AuthService` class may have unnecessary dependencies on other classes or libraries that are not directly relevant to its functionality.\n7. **Lack of Abstraction**: The `AuthService` class may not provide a clear abstraction for authentication, logging out users, and sending login notifications. This can make it difficult to understand the code's purpose and intent.\n8. **Unclear Responsibilities**: The responsibilities of the `AuthService` class are unclear, leading to confusion about its purpose and functionality.\n9. **Lack of Reusability**: The `AuthService` class may not be reusable in other contexts due to its tight coupling with other classes or a specific implementation.\n10. **Poor Encapsulation**: The internal details of the `AuthService` class may not be properly encapsulated, leading to potential security risks and maintenance issues.\n\nThe code violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) because the `AuthService` class has multiple responsibilities related to authentication, logging out users, and sending login notifications. To fix this, we can refactor the code by separating these concerns into separate classes or modules.\n\nHere's an example of a refactored version:", "solution_code": "interface Authenticator {\n    fun authenticate(username: String, password: String): Boolean\n}\nclass LoginAuthenticator : Authenticator {\n    override fun authenticate(username: String, password: String): Boolean {\n        // Implementation for login authentication\n    }\n}\nclass LogoutAuthenticator : Authenticator {\n    override fun authenticate(username: String, password: String): Boolean {\n        // Implementation for logout authentication\n    }\n}\ninterface NotificationSender {\n    fun sendNotification(user: User)\n}\nclass LoginNotificationSender : NotificationSender {\n    override fun sendNotification(user: User) {\n        // Implementation for sending login notification\n    }\n}", "duration_seconds": 48.90147137641907}

The `OrderFulfillmentService` class is now responsible for orchestrating the fulfillment process, while other classes handle specific tasks like inventory reservation, shipping label generation, order status update, and shipping notification sending. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and extend the code in the future.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "1. **Code Smell**: God Object\n2. **SOLID Principle Violated**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n3. **Rating**: 0 (bad) on SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP\n4. **Refactored Code**:", "solution_code": "", "duration_seconds": 102.0338385105133}
