A brief explanation of the violation and the refactoring.\n\nUse these criteria to detect violations:\n- **SRP**: A class does too many unrelated tasks.\n- **OCP**: Multiple `if-else` or `switch` blocks for logic that should be handled by polymorphism.\n- **LSP**: Subclasses override behavior in a way that breaks the contract of the base class (e.g., throw exceptions).\n- **ISP**: Interfaces that are too large or force implementing unnecessary methods.\n- **DIP**: High-level classes directly depend on low-level classes instead of abstractions.\n\nIf more than one violation is present, report only the most prominent one.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Follow this output format *exactly*. Do not include greetings, summaries, or comments before or after the output:\n\n**<VIOLATION TYPE>**\n```c#\n<Refactored code>\n```\n<Explanation of the refactoring>\n\nExample output:\n**SRP**\n```java\npublic class ReportGenerator {\n    public String generateReport() {\n        return \"Report data\";\n    }\n}\n```\nThe class previously handled both data generation and file I/O. Now it only generates the report, following SRP.\n\nHere is the code:\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\n\npublic class CollectionProcessor\n{\n    public virtual void ProcessCollection(List<string> data)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[BaseProcessor] Starting processing...\");\n        foreach (var item in data)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"[BaseProcessor] Processing item: {item}\");\n            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[BaseProcessor] Processing finished.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ModifyingCollectionProcessor : CollectionProcessor\n{\n    public override void ProcessCollection(List<string> data)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[ViolatingProcessor] Starting processing...\");\n        for (int i = 0; i < data.Count; i++)\n        {\n             var item = data[i];\n             Console.WriteLine($\"[ViolatingProcessor] Processing item: {item}\");\n             System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);\n\n             if (item.StartsWith(\"B\"))\n             {\n                 Console.WriteLine($\"[ViolatingProcessor] Removing item: {item}\");\n                 data.RemoveAt(i);\n                 i--;\n             }\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[ViolatingProcessor] Processing finished.

The `ModifyingCollectionProcessor` class violates this principle by modifying the input list during processing, which breaks the contract of the base class. To fix this, we can create a new class `NonModifyingCollectionProcessor` that does not modify the input list and only processes it.", "violation": "LSP", "violation_list": ["LSP"], "explanation": "**LSP**", "solution_code": "public abstract class CollectionProcessor\n{\n    public virtual void ProcessCollection(List<string> data)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[BaseProcessor] Starting processing...\");\n        foreach (var item in data)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"[BaseProcessor] Processing item: {item}\");\n            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);\n        }\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[BaseProcessor] Processing finished.\");\n    }\n}\n\npublic class NonModifyingCollectionProcessor : CollectionProcessor\n{\n    public override void ProcessCollection(List<string> data)\n    {\n        base.ProcessCollection(data);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class ModifyingCollectionProcessor : CollectionProcessor\n{\n    public override void ProcessCollection(List<string> data)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[ViolatingProcessor] Starting processing...\");\n        var newData = new List<string>();\n        foreach (var item in data)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"[ViolatingProcessor] Processing item: {item}\");\n            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10);\n\n            if (!item.StartsWith(\"B\"))\n            {\n                newData.Add(item);\n            }\n        }\n        data.Clear();\n        data.AddRange(newData);\n        Console.WriteLine(\"[ViolatingProcessor] Processing finished.
