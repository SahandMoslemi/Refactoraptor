I've separated the interfaces into more specific ones based on their responsibilities. For example, `Device` now only contains methods related to device control and `AdjustableDevice` is for devices that can have their volume adjusted.\n2. I've created abstract classes for common functionality like turning a device on or off. This allows subclasses to inherit these behaviors without duplicating code.\n3. I've introduced interfaces for specific functionalities like locking. This allows classes to implement only the methods they need, reducing unnecessary dependencies and adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle.\n4. The `RegularLightBulb` class now extends from `LightBulb` instead of implementing `DeviceControl` directly. This follows the Liskov Substitution Principle as it allows for substituting a `RegularLightBulb` with any other device that implements `Device` without changing the behavior of the program.\n5. The `SmartLock` class now implements both `Device` and `Lockable` interfaces, adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle.\n6. I've removed unnecessary methods from the `DeviceControl` interface and moved them into more specific interfaces or classes where they belong. This reduces dependencies and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n7. The Single Responsibility Principle is partially met as each class now has a single responsibility, but there are still some responsibilities that could be separated out further. For example, volume control and locking functionality could be moved into their own interfaces or classes.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "SOLID RATINGS:\n- SRP: 0 - The Single Responsibility Principle is violated because all classes have more than one responsibility.

For example, a mage can fly but a fighter cannot. This breaks the substitutability principle of the parent class `Character`.\n- ISP: 2 - The Interface Segregation Principle is partially satisfied. It's fine to have many client specific interfaces as long as they are smaller and more focused, but in this case, all methods are part of a single interface which is not ideal.\n- DIP: 5 - The Dependency Inversion Principle is violated because high level modules depend on low level modules. For example, `GameContext` class depends directly on the concrete classes (`Mage`, `Fighter`, `Ranger`) instead of an abstraction.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: LSP\n\n**Refactored Code**", "solution_code": "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass Character(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def walk(self):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def display_role(self):\n        pass\n\nclass MeleeAttacker(Character):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def melee_attack(self):\n        pass\n\nclass RangedAttacker(Character):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def ranged_attack(self):\n        pass\n\nclass MagicUser(Character):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def cast_spell(self):\n        pass\n\nclass FlyingMobility(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def fly(self):\n        pass\n\nclass NonFlyingMobility(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def walk(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Mage(MagicUser, FlyingMobility, NonFlyingMobility):\n    def cast_spell(self):\n        print(\"Mage casts a fireball.\")\n\n    def fly(self):\n        print(\"Mage flies magically.\")\n\n    def walk(self):\n        print(\"Mage walks gracefully.\")\n\n    def display_role(self):\n        print(\"Current character: Mage\")\n\nclass Fighter(MeleeAttacker, NonFlyingMobility):\n    def melee_attack(self):\n        print(\"Fighter slashes with a sword!\")\n\n    def walk(self):\n        print(\"Fighter stomps forward.\")\n\n    def display_role(self):\n        print(\"Current character: Fighter\")\n\nclass Ranger(RangedAttacker, NonFlyingMobility):\n    def ranged_attack(self):\n        print(\"Ranger stabs with a dagger.\")\n\n    def walk(self):\n        print(\"Ranger moves swiftly.\")\n\n    def display_role(self):\n        print(\"Current character: Ranger\")\n\nclass GameContext:\n    def __init__(self, character: Character):\n        self.character = character\n\n    def set_character(self, new_character: Character):\n        self.character = new_character\n\n    def move(self):\n        if isinstance(self.character, FlyingMobility):\n            self.character.fly()\n        else:\n            self.character.walk()\n\n    def attack(self):\n        if isinstance(self.character, MeleeAttacker):\n            self.character.melee_attack()\n        elif isinstance(self.character, RangedAttacker):\n            self.character.ranged_attack()\n        elif isinstance(self.character, MagicUser):\n            self.character.cast_spell()\n\n    def display(self):\n        self.character.display_role()", "duration_seconds": 37.99915814399719}

For example, SmartSpeaker cannot play media because it doesn't have a screen, but it still implements the MultimediaDevice interface and can be used in place of any other MultimediaDevice.\n- ISP: 5 - The Interface Segregation Principle is met as all interfaces are small and specific to their needs. For example, NetworkDevice only has methods related to network functionality, and MultimediaDevice only has methods related to multimedia functionality.\n- DIP: 4 - The Dependency Inversion Principle is partially met because the DeviceManager class directly depends on concrete classes (NetworkDevice and MultimediaDevice), not abstract ones. However, it's not fully adhered to because the DeviceManager class directly checks the type of a device and calls its methods, which violates the principle.\n\nMOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: SRP\n\n**Refactored Code**", "solution_code": "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass NetworkDevice(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def connect(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def update_firmware(self, version: str):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def display_info(self):\n        pass\n\nclass MultimediaDevice(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def power_on(self):\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def play(self):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def set_volume(self, level: int):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def display_info(self):\n        pass\n\nclass SmartTV(NetworkDevice, MultimediaDevice):\n    # Implementations...\n\nclass SmartSpeaker(MultimediaDevice):\n    # Implementations...\n\nclass DeviceManager:\n    def configure_device(self, device):\n        device.display_info()\n        if isinstance(device, NetworkDevice):\n            device.connect()\n        elif isinstance(device, MultimediaDevice):\n            device.power_on()\n\n    def update_firmware(self, device: NetworkDevice):\n        print(f\"Updating firmware for {device.get_device_name()}\")\n        device.update_firmware(\"v2.4.1\")\n\n    def play_media(self, device: MultimediaDevice):\n        print(f\"Playing media on {device.get_device_name()}\")\n        device.play()\n\n    def adjust_volume(self, device: MultimediaDevice, level: int):\n        print(f\"Adjusting volume on {device.get_device_name()}\")\n        device.set_volume(level)", "duration_seconds": 30.11626386642456}

Each subclass (EmailService, SMSService, EmailClient) implements this method according to their needs. This way, each class only has one responsibility: sending or receiving notifications.\n- I've removed the unnecessary methods from the classes that don't use them. For example, `send_sms()` and `send_push_notification()` were removed from EmailService because they are not used by this class.\n- The code is now more maintainable and extensible as new notification services or receivers can be added without modifying existing classes. \n- However, the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is still violated because high-level modules depend on low-level modules. This could be improved by using dependency injection to invert these dependencies.", "violation": "SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP", "violation_list": ["SRP", "OCP", "LSP", "ISP", "DIP"], "explanation": "SOLID RATINGS:\n- SRP: 0 - The Single Responsibility Principle is violated because each class has more than one responsibility, such as sending notifications and receiving notifications.\n- OCP: 3 - The Open/Closed Principle is partially met because the code allows for extension (new notification services or receivers can be added), but it's not closed for modification since every time a new service or receiver is added, all existing classes need to be modified.\n- LSP: 5 - The Liskov Substitution Principle is violated because the subclasses of NotificationSender and NotificationReceiver are forced to implement methods they don't use.
