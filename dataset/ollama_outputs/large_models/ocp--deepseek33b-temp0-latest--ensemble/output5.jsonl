It does not have any other responsibilities such as logging or updating the order repository.\n- OCP: 4 - The ShipmentCostCalculator class can be extended without modifying its existing code. This means that if we want to add a new shipping method in the future, we just need to create a new class implementing the ShippingMethod interface and it will work seamlessly with the rest of the system.\n- LSP: 5 - The classes do not violate the Liskov Substitution Principle because they don't have any methods that can be overridden in subclasses that would break their behavior.\n- ISP: 4 - The interfaces are small and focused, which means they only contain what is necessary for each class to function properly. For example, the ShippingMethod interface only contains a single method calculateCost(), which is exactly what it needs to do.\n- DIP: 5 - All classes depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concretions (classes). This means that if we want to change the implementation of any class, we just need to provide a new implementation for its interface and everything else will continue working as before.

It should only be responsible for one thing.\n- OCP: 2 - The ContentFilter class can be extended to handle different types of content without modifying its existing code, but it's not open for extension in terms of adding new filters or removing existing ones.\n- LSP: 3 - The subclasses of the ContentFilter class may break the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) if they don't behave as expected when substituted for their superclass. For example, the filter_email_content method might not work correctly with a different type of content.\n- ISP: 4 - The ContentFilter class is implementing an interface that it doesn't need to implement. It's using methods from other classes without depending on them through interfaces. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).\n- DIP: 5 - The ContentFilter class depends on concrete classes (Content and re), which is against the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

The TextContent class is responsible for holding content data and providing access to it, while the EmailContentFilter class is responsible for filtering email content.\n2. I've created an interface called ContentFilter that all filters will implement. This follows the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) as new types of content can be added without modifying existing code.\n3.

Each interface should have a single responsibility, and this method only filters email content.\n4. I've moved the removePersonalInfo method to its own private function within the EmailContentFilter class. This follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as it is now responsible for removing personal information from text.\n5.
