The Bicycle class inherits from Vehicle but overrides the start_engine method, which violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).\n\nHere's how you can refactor it to comply with SRP and LSP:\n\nclass Vehicle:\n    def drive(self):\n        raise NotImplementedError('This vehicle cannot be driven')\n\nclass EngineVehicle(Vehicle):\n    def start_engine(self):\n        print('Engine started')\n\n    def drive(self):\n        self.start_engine()\n        print('Driving the engine vehicle')\n\nclass Bicycle(Vehicle):\n    def drive(self):\n        print('Riding the bicycle')\n\nNow, Vehicle has a single responsibility: driving. EngineVehicle and Bicycle have their own responsibilities: starting an engine and riding a bicycle, respectively. The LSP is also satisfied because Bicycle does not override any methods from its parent class.", "solution_code": "", "duration_seconds": 15.914899110794067}
