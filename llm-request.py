2. Select the most impactful violation

SOLID RATINGS:
- SRP: [score] - [reasoning]

MOST IMPACTFUL VIOLATION: [principle or NONE]

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS:

**[VIOLATION TYPE or NONE]**

[Explanation of violation]

REMEMBER: 
- If there is NO violation, write **NONE** and provide no explanation.
- If there IS a violation, provide an explanation of what makes it a violation.
